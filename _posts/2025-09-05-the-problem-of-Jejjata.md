## Jejjaṭa

Related to the [the problem of Candraṭa](https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/the-problem-of-Candrata/), we may note that manuscripts containing the "Candraṭa verse" that ends, "... आलोक्य जैज्जटीं ||" have sometimes been misinterpreted as containing a commentary by Jejjaṭa.  This is the case, for example, with MS Bikaner Anup 4391, that was reported in this way in NCC {% cite ncc -A -l 7: 317 %}.  This led Meulenbeld to assert the existence of a commentary by Jejjaṭa on the basis of this manuscript {% cite meul-hist -l 1B 506 n.360 %}.  In fact, MS Bikaner Anup 4391 is the text of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, with the Candraṭa verse in the colophon.   It is likely that this is the same case for MS London IOLR Taylor 1842: this is currently being investigated. 

MSS currently known to have the Candraṭa verse:

*  [MS Bikaner Anup 4391](https://panditproject.org/entity/108211/manuscript)
*  [MS London IOLR Taylor 1842](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108178/manuscript)
*  [MS Kurukṣetra Jawaharlal Nehru Library 19786](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/113349/manuscript), f. 78v
*  [MS Los Angeles LACMA M.87.271c (ma-44977.tiff)](https://panditproject.org/entity/108634/manuscript)
*  [MS Kolkata ASB G. 5275](https://panditproject.org/entity/109395/manuscript), part III (according to the catalogue)

### Testimonia 

There are numerous statements in the secondary literature asserting that commentators cite Jejjaṭa's commentary on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.  For example, the NCC (idem) names Hemādri, Vijayarakṣita, Ṭoḍarānanda, Nāganātha, and Rūpanayana, to  which Meulenbeld adds Ḍalhaṇa, Gayadāsa and Niścalakara  (ibid, v. 1A, p. 385).  Some of these may indeed be concrete evidence for a commentary on the Suśrutasaṃhitā by Jejjaṭa.  They need to be studied individually, especially those of Ḍalhaṇa and Niścalakara.  

D. C. Bhattacharyya {% cite bhat-1947 -l 112, note 1%} stated of Rudrapāraśara's early edition of the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha* with the commentary *Śaśilekhā* by [Indu](https://panditproject.org/entity/40853/person)  {% cite rudr-1924 %}, that,

> The editor [Rudrapāraśara] had to rely on imperfect and fragmentary Mss. of the Śaśilekhā.  But, ... he filled up a lacuna in the Śaśilekhā with the text of the Nirantarapadī commentary (on Suśruta) by Jarjaṭa (vol. II, p. 298), which seems to be quite accessible to him, though it is a sealed book to the world outside. Many notes from Jarjaṭa [Jejjaṭa] have been printed in vols II and III."

The passage on p. 298 of Rudrapāraśara’s edition reads as follows:

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298.png:img?width=250" title="Rudrapāraśara 1924, v.2, p.298." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

>द्रोणेऽम्भस इतयारभ्य श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्येत्यन्तग्रन्थस्य शशिलेखाया अदर्शनात् जर्जटकृता निरन्तरपदी व्याख्या लिख्यते । 
>द्रोणेऽम्भस इत्यादि । जीवनीयैः जीवन्त्यादिभिर्महाकषायसङ्ग्रहोक्तैर् दशभिः । फल्गुर्गोष्ठोदुम्बरः ॥
>
>Because the *Śaśilekhā* is unavailable starting from the passage "द्रोणेऽम्भस" [As.ci.23.40] and ending with  the passage "श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्य" [As.ci.23.61], a  commentary Nirantarapadī, composed by Jarjaṭa, is written. …
>

This is an interesting passage, but both of Bhattacharyya’s assertions about it are probably wrong.  One has to ask, “whose voice is this commentarial statement?”   It is unlikely that it was Rudrapāraśara, in the 1920s, who originated this comment.  The passage is printed in the same size and font as the rest of the text of the *Śaśilekhā*.   By contrast, p. 300 shows the typography of a note from Rudrapāraśara himself:

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300.png:img?width=250" title="Rudrapāraśara 1924, v.2, p.300." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

 It is unlikely that Indu (fl. ca. 1000–1150) would have referred to his own commentary by name.  On the other hand, the text prints an editors footnote to the text with an asterisk and a different font (p. 300, with two references to Jarjaṭa).As suggested by Deepro Chakraborty, it is more likely that the passage is printed in the book as Rudrapāraśara saw it in the manuscript, i.e., as part of the manuscript of Indu's commentary.  It may be possible to check this, if one can find the manuscript from which Rudrapāraśara was working.   Second, there is nothing in this passage to suggest that Rudrapāraśara had access to a commentary by Jejjaṭa's on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*  On the contrary, the name *Nirantarapadī* is an abbreviation of the name of Jejjaṭa's commentary on the *Carakasaṃhitā*, i.e., “*Nirantarapadavyākhyā*.”  



A complicating factor is that the 1980 edition of Āṭhavale prints exactly the same passage in the same way {% cite atha-1980 -l 557-558 %}.  The most likely explanation is that Āṭhavale was simply reproducing Rudrapāraśara's edition without thought at this point.  Āṭhavale was fully aware of the earlier edition and frames his own edition as being necessary because Rudrapāraśara's edition had gone out of print.  Only a fresh examination of the manuscripts will clear up this point. 

In any case, those passages that I have examined from Indu on the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha* are from Jejjaṭa on the *Carakasaṃhitā*, not the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.  Further study is required to clarify and clarify this.

At the time of writing, the fact that Ḍalhaṇa and others apparently cite Jejjaṭa while writing on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* makes it likely that there was once a commentary by Jejjaṭa on that text.  However, the commentary is lost and the manuscripts that have been cited as containing parts of the commentary do not do so.
