## Jejjaṭa

Related to the the problem of Candraṭa, we may note that manuscripts containing the "Candraṭa verse" that ends, "... आलोक्य जैज्जटीं ||" have sometimes been misinterpreted as containing a commentary by Jejjaṭa.  This is the case, for example, with MS Bikaner Anup 4391, that was reported in this way in NCC {% cite ncc -A -l 7: 317 %}.  This led Meulenbeld to assert the existence of a commentary by Jejjaṭa on the basis of this manuscript {% cite meul-hist -l 1B 506 n.360 %}.  In fact, MS Bikaner Anup 4391 is the text of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, with the Candraṭa verse in the colophon.   It is likely that this is the same case for MS London IOLR Taylor 1842: this is currently being investigated. 

MSS currently known to have the Candraṭa verse:

*  [MS Bikaner Anup 4391](https://panditproject.org/entity/108211/manuscript)
*  [MS London IOLR Taylor 1842](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108178/manuscript)
*  [MS Kurukṣetra Jawaharlal Nehru Library 19786](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/113349/manuscript), f. 78v

### Testimonia 

There are numerous statements in the secondary literature asserting that commentators cite Jejjaṭa's commentary on the Suśrutasaṃhitā.  For example, the NCC (idem) names Hemādri, Vijayarakṣita, Ṭoḍarānanda, Nāganātha, and Rūpanayana, to  which Meulenbeld adds Ḍalhaṇa, Gayadāsa and Niścalakara  (ibid, v. 1A, p. 385).  Some of these may indeed be concrete evidence for a commentary on the Suśrutasaṃhitā by Jejjaṭa.  They need to be studied individually, especially those of Ḍalhaṇa and Niścalakara.  

D. C. Bhattacharyya {% cite bhat-1947 -l 112, note 1%} noted of Rudrapāraśara's early edition of the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha* with the commentary *Śaśilekhā* by [Indu](https://panditproject.org/entity/40853/person)  {% cite rudr-1924 %}, that,

> The editor [Rudrapāraśara] had to rely on imperfect and fragmentary Mss. of the Śaśilekhā.  But, ... he filled up a lacuna in the Śaśilekhā with the text of the Nirantarapadī commentary (on Suśruta) by Jarjaṭa (vol. II, p. 298), which seems to be quite accessible to him, though it is a sealed book to the world outside. Many notes from Jarjaṭa [Jejjaṭa] have been printed in vols II and III."

The passage on p. 298 of Rudrapāraśara’s edition reads as follows:

>द्रोणेऽम्भस इतयारभ्य श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्येत्यन्तग्रन्थस्य शशिलेखाया अदर्शनात् जर्जटकृता निरन्तरपदी व्याख्या लिख्यते । 
>द्रोणेऽम्भस इत्यादि । जीवनीयैः जीवन्त्यादिभिर्महाकषायसङ्ग्रहोक्तैर् दशभिः । फल्गुर्गोष्ठोदुम्बरः ॥
>
>Because the *Śaśilekhā* is unavailable starting from the passage "द्रोणेऽम्भस" and ending with  the passage "श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्य," a  commentary Nirantarapadī, composed by Jarjaṭa, is written.
>
> "द्रोणेऽम्भस", etc. With ten life-giving [drugs], beginning with *Jīvantī*, as mentioned in the "Mahākaṣāyasaṅgraha." *Phalgu* means "goṣṭhodumbaraḥ".

Bhattacharyya suggested that it was Rudrapāraśara, in the 1920s, who had access to Jejjaṭa's *Nirantarapadī* commentary on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.  This seems to be correct, even though the passage is printed as if it were the text of the *Śaśilekhā*.  It is unlikely that Indu (fl. ca. 1000–1150) would have referred to his own commentary by name

In any case, those passages that I have examined from Indu on the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha* are from Jejjaṭa on the *Carakasaṃhitā*, not the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.  Further study is required to clarify and confirm this.

At the time of writing, the fact that Ḍalhaṇa and others apparently cite Jejjaṭa while writing on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* makes it likely that there was once a commentary by Jejjaṭa on that text.  However, the commentary is lost and the manuscripts that have been cited as containing parts of the commentary do not do so.
