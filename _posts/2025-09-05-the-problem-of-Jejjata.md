## Jejjaṭa

Related to the [the problem of Candraṭa](https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/the-problem-of-Candrata/), we may note that manuscripts containing the "Candraṭa verse" that ends, "... आलोक्य जैज्जटीं ||" have sometimes been misinterpreted as containing a commentary by Jejjaṭa.  This is the case, for example, with MS Bikaner Anup 4391, that was reported in this way in NCC {% cite ncc -A -l 7: 317 %}.  This led Meulenbeld to assert the existence of a manuscript of a  commentary by Jejjaṭa on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* {% cite meul-hist -l 1B 506 n.360 %}.  In fact, MS Bikaner Anup 4391 is the text of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, with the Candraṭa verse in the colophon.   It is likely that this is the same case for MS London IOLR Taylor 1842: this is currently being investigated, but which initially seems to be a manuscript supporting the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* with the commentary of Ḍalhaṇa, but nothing by the author Candraṭa.

MSS currently known to have the so-called Candraṭa verse:

*  [MS Bikaner Anup 4391](https://panditproject.org/entity/108211/manuscript)
*  [MS London IOLR Taylor 1842](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108178/manuscript)
*  [MS Kurukṣetra Jawaharlal Nehru Library 19786](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/113349/manuscript), f. 78v
*  [MS Los Angeles LACMA M.87.271c (ma-44977.tiff)](https://panditproject.org/entity/108634/manuscript)
*  [MS Kolkata ASB G. 5275](https://panditproject.org/entity/109395/manuscript), part III (according to the catalogue)

### Testimonia 

There are also numerous statements in the secondary literature asserting that commentators cite Jejjaṭa's commentary on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.  For example, the NCC (idem) names Hemādri, Vijayarakṣita, Ṭoḍarānanda, Nāganātha, and Rūpanayana, to  which Meulenbeld added Ḍalhaṇa, Gayadāsa and Niścalakara  (ibid, v. 1A, p. 385).  Some of these may indeed be concrete evidence for a commentary on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* by Jejjaṭa.  They need to be studied individually, especially those of Ḍalhaṇa and Niścalakara.  

#### Indu’s commentary on the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha*

D. C. Bhattacharyya {% cite bhat-1947 -l 112, note 1%} stated of Rudrapāraśara's early edition of the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha* with the commentary *Śaśilekhā* by [Indu](https://panditproject.org/entity/40853/person)  {% cite rudr-1924 %}, that,

> The editor [Rudrapāraśara] had to rely on imperfect and fragmentary Mss. of the Śaśilekhā.  But, ... he filled up a lacuna in the Śaśilekhā with the text of the Nirantarapadī commentary (on Suśruta) by Jarjaṭa (vol. II, p. 298), which seems to be quite accessible to him, though it is a sealed book to the world outside. Many notes from Jarjaṭa [Jejjaṭa] have been printed in vols II and III."

The passage on p. 298 of Rudrapāraśara’s edition reads as follows:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298.png" title="Rudrapāraśara 1924, v.2, p.298." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
 <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
 द्रोणेऽम्भस इतयारभ्य श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्येत्यन्तग्रन्थस्य शशिलेखाया अदर्शनात् जर्जटकृता निरन्तरपदी व्याख्या लिख्यते । 
द्रोणेऽम्भस इत्यादि । जीवनीयैः जीवन्त्यादिभिर्महाकषायसङ्ग्रहोक्तैर् दशभिः । फल्गुर्गोष्ठोदुम्बरः ॥

Because the *Śaśilekhā* is unavailable starting from the passage "द्रोणेऽम्भस" [As.ci.23.40] and ending with  the passage "श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्य" [As.ci.23.61], a  commentary Nirantarapadī, composed by Jarjaṭa, is written. …

This is an interesting passage, but both of Bhattacharyya’s assertions about it are probably wrong.  One has to ask, “whose voice is this commentarial statement?” It is impossible that Indu (fl. ca. 1000–1150) would have referred to his own commentary by name, saying that it was incomplete.  It is also unlikely that it was Rudrapāraśara, in the 1920s.  The passage is printed in the same size and font as the rest of the text of the *Śaśilekhā*. By contrast, p. 300 shows the typography of an editorial comment from Rudrapāraśara himself:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300.png" title="Rudrapāraśara 1924, v.2, p.300." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
 <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
As we see, the text prints the editor’s footnote to the text with an asterisk and a different font (p. 300, with two references to Jarjaṭa). Note, too, the reference to 
the Carakasaṃhitā (चरकपाठः).

As suggested by Deepro Chakraborty (personal communication), it is more likely that the passage printed in the book is what Rudrapāraśara saw in his source, namely the *manuscript* of Indu's commentary.  Therefore, the comment would be that of a scribe who produced the manuscript that Rudrapāraśara was reading.  This would be a scribal insertion, perhaps from the margin of the archetype of Rudrapāraśara's manuscript, responding to physical damage to the manuscript,  that had migrated into the body of the main text during the next copying.  This is a common feature of manuscript transmission.  It may be possible to check this, if one can find the manuscript from which Rudrapāraśara was working.   

Regarding Bhattacharyya's second assertion, there is nothing in this passage to suggest that Rudrapāraśara had access to a commentary by Jejjaṭa's on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*  On the contrary, the name *Nirantarapadī* is an abbreviation of the name of Jejjaṭa's commentary on the *Carakasaṃhitā*, i.e., “*Nirantarapadavyākhyā*” {% cite zysk-2019 sast-1975 %}. Further, on p. 300 (above)  there is an explicit reference to the version of the passage under discussion as it appears in the text of the *Carakasaṃhitā* (चरकपाठे).

Other passages in the *Śaśilekhā* that require study because they refer to Jejjaṭa include Ni.2.3, Ci.9.50 and 51-52, Utt.30.79 and 80, 38.2-6a {% cite meul-hist -l 1A: 670 %}

While I criticize Bhattacharyya's assertions above, his 1947 paper was nevertheless a landmark contribution to medical history.  He published much valid historical and prosopographical information for the first time through his extremely close reading of the sources. 

A minor complicating factor is that the 1980 edition of the Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha edited by Āṭhavale prints exactly the same passage in exactly the same way {% cite atha-1980 -l 557-558 %}.  The most likely explanation is that Āṭhavale was simply reproducing Rudrapāraśara's edition without thought at this point.  (A print example of the scribal mechanism described above!)  Āṭhavale was fully aware of the earlier edition and frames his own edition as being necessary because Rudrapāraśara's edition had gone out of print.  Only a fresh examination of the manuscripts will clear up this point. 

In any case, those passages that I have examined from Indu on the *Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha* are from Jejjaṭa on the *Carakasaṃhitā*, not the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.  Further study is required to clarify and clarify this.

At the time of writing, the fact that Ḍalhaṇa and others apparently cite Jejjaṭa while writing on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, and that Candraṭa said his revisions to the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* were made after studying Jejjaṭa, make it likely that there was once a commentary by Jejjaṭa on that text.  However, the commentary is lost and the manuscripts that have been cited as containing parts of the commentary do not do so.
