# On the date of the Suśrutasaṃhitā

The early scholar Rudolf Hoernle proposed that some concepts from the *Suśruta-Saṃhitā* could be found in the *[Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shatapatha_Brahmana)*, which he dated to the 600 BCE.[[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta#cite_note-16)  However, during the last century, scholarship on the history of Indian medical literature has advanced substantially, and firm evidence has  accumulated that the *Suśruta-saṃhitā* is a work of several  historical layers. Its composition may have begun in the last centuries  BCE, completed in its present form by another author who redacted its  first five chapters and added the long, final chapter, the  "Uttaratantra". It is likely that the *Suśruta-saṃhitā* was known to the scholar Dṛḍhabala, a contributor to the [Charaka Samhita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charaka_Samhita) that wrote between the fourth and fifth centuries CE.[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta#cite_note-:1-17) Additionally, several ancient Indian authors used the name "Suśruta", resulting in potential misattribution.[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta#cite_note-:1-17)





The most detailed and extensive consideration of the date of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* is that published by Meulenbeld in his *History of Indian Medical Literature* (1999–2002). Meulenbeld states that the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* is likely a work that includes several historical layers, whose  composition may have begun in the last centuries BCE and was completed  in its presently surviving form by another author who redacted its first five sections and added the long, final section, the "Uttaratantra."[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999203–389_(Volume_IA)-1) It is likely that the *Suśruta-saṃhitā* was known to the scholar [Dṛḍhabala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dṛḍhabala) [[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityPage/Q107208659#sitelinks-wikipedia)] (fl. 300–500 CE), which gives the latest date for the version of the work that has survived into the modern era.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999203–389_(Volume_IA)-1)

In *Suśrutasaṃhitā - A Scientific Synopsis*, the historians of Indian science Ray, Gupta and Roy noted the following view, which is broadly the same as Meulenbeld's:[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-8)

> "The Chronology Committee of the National Institute of Sciences of India (Proceedings, 1952),[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-9) was of the opinion that third to fourth centuries A. D. may be accepted as the date of the recension of the Suśruta Saṃhitā by Nāgārjuna, which formed the basis of Dallaṇa's commentary."

The above view remains the consensus amongst university scholars of the history of Indian medicine and Sanskrit literature.

#### Hoernle's view

The scholar [Rudolf Hoernle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Hoernle) (1841–1918) proposed in 1907 that because the author of the *[Śatapathabrāhmaṇa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satapatha_Brahmana)*, a Vedic text from the mid-first-millennium BCE, was aware of [Sushruta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta)'s doctrines, Sushruta's work should be dated based on the composition date of *Śatapathabrāhmaṇa*.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle19078-10) The composition date of the Brahmana was itself unclear, added Hoernle, but he estimated it to be about the sixth century BCE.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle19078-10)  However, Hoernle's view was based on the unexamined assumption that the ideas about the human skeleton in the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* preceded those of the *Brāhmaṇa.* He seems never to have questioned this assumption.  

Hoernle's date of 600 BCE for the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* was challenged by intervening scholarship over the last century.  This scholarship was summarized by Meulenbeld in his *History of Indian Medical Literature*.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-:1-11)  

Central to the problem of chronology is the fact that the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* was the work of several hands. The internal tradition recorded in  manuscript colophons and by medieval commentators makes clear that an  old version of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* consisted of sections 1-5, with the sixth part having been added by a later author.  However, the  oldest extant manuscripts include the sixth section, called "The Later  Book" (Skt. Uttara-tantra). Manuscript colophons refer to the whole work as "The Suśrutasaṃhitā together with the Uttara-tantra," reinforcing  the idea that they are a combined work.  Thus, it does not make sense to speak of "the date of Suśruta."  Like "Hippocrates," the name "Suśruta" refers to the work of many authors working over several centuries.

#### Further views on chronology

As mentioned above, scores of scholars have proposed hypotheses on the formation and dating of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, ranging from 2000 BCE to the sixth century CE. These views have been  gathered and described by the medical historian Jan Meulenbeld.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999341–346-12)

*Sushruta* or *Suśruta* ([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit): **सुश्रुत**, [IAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAST): *Suśruta*, lit. 'well heard',[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-13) an adjective meaning "renowned"[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-14)) is named in the text as the author, who is presented in later  manuscripts and printed editions a narrating the teaching of his guru,  Divodāsa.[[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-:0-15)[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-16) Early Buddhist [Jatakas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jataka_tales) mention a Divodāsa as a physician who lived and taught in ancient Kashi ([Varanasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi_district)).[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-:1-11) The earliest known mentions of the name Suśruta firmly associated with the tradition of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* is in the *[Bower Manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bower_Manuscript)* (4th or 5th century CE), where Suśruta is listed as one of the ten sages residing in the Himalayas.[[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKutumbian2005XXXII–XXXIII-17) 

After a review of all past scholarship on the identity of Suśruta, Meulenbeld concluded that: 

> As is obvious from the foregoing, it is rather generally assumed that we  owe the main part of the Suśrutasaṃhitā or an earlier version of it to a historical person called Suśruta.  This assumption, however, is not  based on uncontrovertible evidence and may be illusory.  The text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā does not warrant that the one who composed it was a  Suśruta.  The structure oif the treatise shows without ambiguity that  the author, who created a coherent whole out of earlier material,  attributed the teachings incorporated in his work to Kāśirāja  Divodāsa...[[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999342-18)
