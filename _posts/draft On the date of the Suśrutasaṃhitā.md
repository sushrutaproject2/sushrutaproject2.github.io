# On the date of the Suśrutasaṃhitā

The early scholar Rudolf Hoernle proposed that some concepts from the *Suśruta-Saṃhitā* could be found in the *[Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shatapatha_Brahmana)*, which he dated to the 600 BCE.[[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta#cite_note-16)  However, during the last century, scholarship on the history of Indian medical literature has advanced substantially, and firm evidence has  accumulated that the *Suśruta-saṃhitā* is a work of several  historical layers. Its composition may have begun in the last centuries  BCE, completed in its present form by another author who redacted its  first five chapters and added the long, final chapter, the  "Uttaratantra". It is likely that the *Suśruta-saṃhitā* was known to the scholar Dṛḍhabala, a contributor to the [Charaka Samhita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charaka_Samhita) that wrote between the fourth and fifth centuries CE.[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta#cite_note-:1-17) Additionally, several ancient Indian authors used the name "Suśruta", resulting in potential misattribution.[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta#cite_note-:1-17)
