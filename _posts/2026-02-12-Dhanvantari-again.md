Jason has discovered a historically important statement in Gayadāsa's commentary on the *Śārīrasthāna*. 

As mentioned in yesterday's blog post, the *[Nyāyacandrikā](https://panditproject.org/index.php/entity/108025/work)* by [Gayadāsa](https://panditproject.org/index.php/entity/108024/person) (fl. ca. 1000, Bengal) is one of the important early  commentaries on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.    It was discussed by Meulenbeld {% cite meul-hist -l 1A: 380-383 %}. 

Gayadāsa first discussed the title and opening statement of chapter 1 of the *Śārīrasthāna*.  Then he came to the immediately following phrase "यथोवाच धन्वन्तरिः",  "as was declared by Dhanvantari," which appears in almost all printed editions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā and which has already been the subject of a paper from this project {% birc-2021 %}.  

Gayadāsa said:  

> यथोवाच धन्वंतरिरिति प्रतिसंस्कर्तृसूत्रं॥ 
>
> "As Dhanvantari declared" is a statement by the editor. 

Very little of the Nyāyacandrikā survives.  Today, we have only the following fragments:

Sūtrasthāna
:     MS Bikaner Anup 4389

Nidānasthāna
:     MS Bikaner Anup 4390 ([Paris BnF Cordier 1177](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b100905830/f3.highres) & 1235 are copies of Anup 4390)

Śārīrasthāna
:     MS Jaipur RORI 6838
:    MS [Cambridge UL add. 2491](https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-02491/1)

Kalpasthāna
:    MS Bikaner RORI 5157

The only fragment to be published is the commentary on the *Nidānasthāna*, which was edited and included by Yādavaśarman Trivikramji Ācārya in his 1938 edition of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*  {% cite susr-1938 %}.
