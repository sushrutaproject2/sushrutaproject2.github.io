In 2023, the Suśruta Project published an open-access monograph entitled, *On the Plastic Surgery of the Ears and Nose: The Nepalese Version of the “Suśrutasaṃhitā”* (Heidelberg: Heidelberg Asian Studies
Publishing), https://doi.org/10.11588/hasp.1203.

A book review by Prof. Martha Selby (Harvard) has recently been published in the journal *Asian Medicine*.  I am grateful to Prof. Selby for her highly positive review, and I congratulate the members of our project who worked hard on this book.

The review is paywalled, but you can read most of it [here](http://doi.org/10.1163/15734218-12341598).  The final sentence of the review, which is partly hidden, reads: 

> “This work is not “just” a critical edition, but a very fine example of what a critical edition should do, which is to produce a “life of the text”; in this case, a veritable biography of this chapter of one of the most important texts in world medical history.”
