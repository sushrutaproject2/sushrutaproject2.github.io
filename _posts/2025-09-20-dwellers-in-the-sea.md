## Introduction (Dominik Wujastyk)

The following post illustrates the creative philological process that can lead to an emendation to a text in spite of the transmitted readings of the manuscript witnesses. 

During an online reading seminar, we were puzzled by the Nepalese manuscript readings of passage SS 3.1.3.  In the vulgate version, the passage reads {% cite susr-1938 -l 338 %}:

> tad ekam anekeṣāṃ kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānaṃ samudra **ivaudakanāṃ** bhāvānām ||
>
> That One is the foundation of the many Witnesses, just like the ocean for aquatic (audaka) beings.  

The Nepalese witnesses N and H both read **ivodakaujasāṃ** "for beings who have water as their energy (*ojas*)."  This is an unusual use of the word *ojas* and the meaning of the simile is not clear.   

Philipp Maas, project collaborator ([ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1451-9439)), was able to suggest a compelling solution to this conundrum.

## Reflections (Philipp Maas)

Following our online meeting, the illustration in Śā 1.3 continued to puzzle me. Even if the phrase *tad ekam anekeṣāṃ kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānaṃ samudra ivodakaujasāṃ bhāvānām* makes some sense, it is hardly correct because the technical term -*ojas* as a final part of a bahuvrīhi compound does not fit the context. It  remains unclear what kind of entities or beings could be described as  “having water as their power” and how such a characterisation can be  understood in a comparison (which should be clear without specialist  knowledge) of the role of *avyakta* for the *kṣetrejña*s.


In this situation, an editor could either mark the edited text as corrupt  or suggest an emendation. However, my suggestion to read *ivodakajānāṃ* instead of *ivodakaujasāṃ* was unsatisfactory because there is no reason why the  unobjectionable and easy reading *ivodakajānāṃ* could be changed in the  course of the transmission into the more difficult but apparently  incorrect *ivodakaujasāṃ* in the Nepalese version. I have now found a better solution to this problem and propose a different emendation, namely to emend *udakaujasāṃ* to *udakaukasāṃ* “having water as their house or habitat, living in water, aquatic,” which involves the change of the single akṣara *ja* to *ka*, making *okas* out of *ojas*.


Admittedly, I have not yet been able to detect an occurrence of the word *udakaukas* in Sanskrit literature, but *jalaukas* is quite common, meaning “leech” or “aquatic being” as, for example, in MBh 12.195.22: *śubhāśubhaṃ karma kṛtaṃ yad asya tad eva pratyādadate svadehe / mano 'nuvartanti parāvarāṇi jalaukasaḥ srota ivānukūlam* // (22.2). Since *jalaukas* is a substantivised adjective, nothing prevents the usage of the parallel formation *udakaukas* as a bahuvrīhi meaning “aquatic.”

The passage 

> tad ekam anekeṣāṃ kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānaṃ samudra ivodakaukasāṃ bhāvānām || 

would then translate as 

> This is the single abode of the multiple Selves (“knowers of the field”) like the ocean for aquatic beings.

Emending the text from *ivodakaujasāṃ bhāvānām* to *ivodakaukasāṃ bhāvānām*  satisfies both requirements of emendations. 

* First, the emendation  resolves the issue of meaning. The *dṛṣṭānta* compares the single *avyakta* in which multiple Selves lead their existences with the single ocean, in  which multiple aquatic animals exist. 
* Moreover, it is possible to  explain how the textual corruption occurred in the Nepalese version. A scribe, who did not follow the text or who was unfamiliar with the word  *okas* as a final part of a compound, wrongly corrected what he saw as a  scribal error in his exemplar from -*aukasāṃ* to -*aujasāṃ*. This scenario  is especially probable if one considers the similarity between ja (𑐖) and ka (𑐎) in some Nepalese scripts (see, for example, these characters in the [*Saddharmapuṇḍarīka* ms. dated to 1082](http://www.fanfoyan.com/resour/pale/saddharma.pdf) and the [Mūlamadhyamakakārikā ms. dated to 550-650](https://fanfoyan.com/resour/pale/buddhapalita.pdf)).


As is the case with all emendations, there is no way to attain certainty,  except by consulting new manuscript materials. However, one should keep  in mind that in the course of the transmission from the earliest  examples of Suśruta’s to the Nepalese version, scribal errors will  definitely have occurred, which will make minor amendments necessary here and there to reach a satisfactory text.
