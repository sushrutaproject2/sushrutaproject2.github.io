Ḍalhaṇa said {% cite susr-1938 -l 582 %}: 

> जेज्जटस्तु मूषिककल्पानन्तरं दुन्दुभिस्वनीयं कल्पं पठति //३२//
>
> But Jejjaṭa reads the chapter on the sound of drums after the chapter on rats.

This is a crux separating the Nepalese version from the vulgate text.  In the Kalpasthāna, the Nepalese version has the chapter on drums *before* the chapter on rats.  The vulgate has these chapters the other way around.  This statement by Ḍalhaṇa supports two conclusions.  First, there existed a text of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* “as read by Jejjaṭa," which suggests that Jejjaṭa may have written a commentary on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.  Second, this version of Jejjaṭa followed the Nepalese version, not the vulgate.
