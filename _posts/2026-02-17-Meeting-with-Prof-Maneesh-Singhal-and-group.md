The participants all introduced themselves, giving a thumbnail sketch of their respective interests in the projects.

Prof.  Singhal discussed his project on science and heritage research in India, aiming to establish a museum about Suśruta literature and develop a Suśruta research group.  The museum will include artifacts, reconstructions of ancient surgical instruments, 3D printed materials, paintings, and a movie, funded by the government of India.

Prof. Wujastyk discussed the old Nepalese manuscripts of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that have given us a window onto what the text looked like in the ninth century, and how it differed from what circulates today.  Dr Brooks mentioned, as an example, the fact that the Nepalese version lists 21 surgical instruments while the contemporary printed editions mention only 20. 

The meeting concluded with expressions of gratitude and anticipation for future collaborations.
