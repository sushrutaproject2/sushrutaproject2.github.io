The website of the Suśruta Project 1.0 (2020-2024) has moved from 
http://sushrutaproject.org 
to 
[http://sushrutaproject1.github.io](http://sushrutaproject1.github.io). 

The new starting page for all things "Suśruta Project" is [http://sushrutaproject.github.io](http://sushrutaproject.github.io).

## Archiving and long-term preservation

The original project website, sushrutaproject.org, has been archived at [Archive-it.org](https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20241119213757/https://sushrutaproject.org/) and [at the WayBackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20250915210732/https://sushrutaproject.org/).  There is a copy of the website on a free hosting service, at [https://sushrutaproject.gt.tc](https://sushrutaproject.gt.tc) whose longevity is unknown.  More importantly, the content of that original website has been transferred to the [website at Github](https://sushrutaproject1.github.io) for long term access and preservation.
