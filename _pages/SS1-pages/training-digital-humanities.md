The theories and techniques of Digital Humanities have become ever-more central to scholarly projects in the twenty-first century. But how do early-career scholars gain expertise and understanding in DH? The 2021 publication by Benatti et al., “Learning Digital Humanities in a Community of Practice,” offers important observations about in-project training in Digital Humanities as an alternative to dedicated DH education. The Suśruta Project offers intensive on-the-job training to its participants on this model.

The project’s Fellows and Assistants go through an intensive period of applied learning in a community of practice of Digital Humanities techniques for editorial markup, version control, cloud storage, and interactive collaborative textual criticism. Project participants learn to use best-in-class DH tools for tasks such as,

- The application of the Text Encoding Guidelines to medieval manuscript sources  ,
- XML file creation and editing,
- Version-control and file-sharing, including the use of GitHub,
- Online collaborative text-critical editing,
- File management and transfer using ftp clients,
- International, remote academic project collaboration.

After working on this project, participants will take forward to their future careers a significant set of new skills and experience in Digital Humanities.
