Saktumiva hosts the [evolving critical edition](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/start) of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* that is resulting from the study of the Nepalese manuscripts. This is an incremental edition: you see every sentence as we work on it. Using the controls on the left of the screen, and the “generate apparatus” button, you can generate various different forms of the critical apparatus, for example to compare our edition with the 1931 vulgate. The controls on the top right of the screen allow you to display the edition in different scripts (e.g., देवनागरी, తెలుగు లిపి,  മലയാളം, Newa,Śāradā, etc).

[The Saktumiva site](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/start) also displays the transcription of [MS Kathmandu KL 699](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/102306/manuscript) and sister manuscripts (e.g., the [Sūtrasthāna](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/01-su.su-1-31/kl_699_sutrasthana-1-31), 1-31, of KL 699). Saktumiva allows you to collate KL 699 against other manuscripts and editions in real time. You may also view the diplomatic transcription alongside manuscript images (see [Project Outputs](https://sushrutaproject.org/project-publications/)).
