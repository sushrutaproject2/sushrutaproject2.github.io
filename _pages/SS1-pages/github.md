The Sushruta Project is using [this Github repository]https://github.com/wujastyk/sushrutaproject) as the place for storing manuscript transcriptions. This allows project members to collaborate, work separately and coordinate transcriptions. It also supports fine-grained version control.

The Github e-texts are world-readable, but may be edited only by project members. If you wish to contribute a correction to one of the files, we would be grateful if you could submit an “[issue](https://github.com/wujastyk/sushrutaproject/issues)” at GitHub.
