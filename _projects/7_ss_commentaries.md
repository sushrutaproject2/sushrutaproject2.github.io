Recent research has revealed that at some time after the ninth
century, an aggressive campaign of editorial revision was applied to _The_
_Compendium_, pervasively altering the text and ultimately generating the vulgate
version that we know from printed editions today. 

The project will transcribe and edit previously unstudied medieval commentaries on _The Compendium_ including the surviving fragments of commentaries by 

* Jejjaṭa (fl. ca. 800) ([PanditProject](https://panditproject.org/entity/40830/person)), 
* Candraṭa (fl. ca. 900) ([PanditProject](https://panditproject.org/entity/40937/person)), 
* Gayadāsa (fl. ca. 1000) ([PanditProject](https://panditproject.org/entity/108024/person)).
* Cakrapāṇidatta (fl. ca. 1075)  ([PanditProject](https://panditproject.org/entity/40945/person))

One hypothesis we are considering is that Candraṭa was a key contributor to the rewriting of _The Compendium,_ but this needs to be tested through detailed study. 

None of these commentaries has previously been published or studied in full.  

* None of Jejjaṭa's commentary on the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* survives (parts of his commentary on the *Carakasaṃhitā* do survive).  
* It is looking as though manuscripts that have been reported as being Candraṭa's commentary are in fact the main text of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* with a final verse referring to Candraṭa's editorial work. 
* Parts of Gayadāsa's commentary survive in a very small number of manuscripts.  His commentary on the Nidānasthāna was printed in the Ācāry'as 1938 edition of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* ({% cite susr-1938 %}).
* Cakrapāṇidatta's commentary on the Sūtrasthāna of the Suśrutasaṃhitā was published in Ācārya's 1939 edition {% cite  susr-1939 %}
