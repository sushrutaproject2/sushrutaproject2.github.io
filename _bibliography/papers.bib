  abstract = {Humans and leeches have engaged in human medicine together for at least two thousand years. Perhaps the earliest detailed description of this interaction is found in a chapter on leech therapy from an early first-millennium Sanskrit surgical treatise, the Suśrutasaṃhitā. There we find descriptions of how humans should classify, care for, interpret, and interact with leeches in medical practice. This article contributes to our understanding of leech therapy in South Asia broadly and to the textual history of this important medical treatise through a comparative study of a newly generated “Nepalese version” of the Suśrutasaṃhitā’s chapter “On Leeches” together with the most widely cited version (Āchārya 1938) that was published with Ḍalhaṇa’s twelfth-century commentary. The final portion of the article presents an edition and translation of the Nepalese version of the chapter “On Leeches” prepared by the author along with members of the Suśruta Project. The edition is based on three Nepalese manuscripts, including a palm leaf manuscript dating from 878 C.E., one of the earliest extant Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts of any genre.},

  abstract = {A passage on suffering (duḥkha) in the first section of the Suśruta­saṃhitā (SS), one of the foundational compendia of Āyurveda, elaborates on three kinds of suffering. The very same scheme also occurs in the commentarial literature of Sāṅkhya, one of the oldest and most important philosophical systems of South Asia. In the SS, however, this account leads a solitary life, never referred to in the whole work again, nor in other contemporary medical literature. This article will determine the actual position of this passage within the work and its relation to the Sāṅkhya parallels, and examine other approaches regarding the causation of suffering and disease in the SS. To this end, not only its representation in the vulgate edition of the SS, but also the version appearing in three early Nepalese manuscripts will be considered.},

  abstract = {Most passages on the seasons in works of ancient Indian medicine list frost, spring, summer, rainy season, autumn and winter as the divisions of the year. However, in some contexts, the hibernal season frost (śiśira) is left out and replaced by a second rainy season, called “beginning of the rain” (prāvṛṣ), that is placed between summer and the actual rainy season. In this paper, I first introduce the concept of the seasons and the division of the year into two halves. Second, I examine the dichotomy of the existence, within one scientific corpus, of two seasonal schemes that vary regarding the included seasons. Concerning this matter, I review the investigations of Francis Zimmermann and compare them with Ḍalhaṇas commentary on the relevant passages in the Suśrutasaṃhitā. This analysis shows that Zimmermann was by and large correct when he argued that the two schemes are utilized in specific contexts but it proposes a new terminology for the schemes, understanding them as preventive and reactive instead of distributive and transitive. Finally, an examination of the relevant passages in the lesson on the seasons in the Suśrutasaṃhitā reveals that, contrary to the correspondent lessons in the other sources, here the two schemes are mixed together in a very confusing way. This, in combination with further textual evidence, clearly points to the posteriority of the Suśrutasaṃhitā’s lesson on the seasons compared to its counterparts in the Caraka- and Bhelasaṃhitā.},

therefore, one of the most important commentaries on the Carakasaṃhitā. This
commentary is incomplete, but sufficient portions survive to allow a study of
the earliest form of medical commentary in India. The extant portions of this
commentary are large sections of the Cikitsāsthāna and part of the Kalpasthāna
and Siddhisthāna. The text of Nirantarapadavyākhyā by Jajjaṭa has never been
critically edited. In this paper, we present a text-critical edition and translation
of the Nirantarapadavyākhyā on the Carakasaṃhitā, Cikitsāsthāna Chapter 2,
Quarter 1 (CaCi 2.1) based on several copies of a lost palm-leaf manuscript
in Malayalam script and the printed edition by Haridatta Śāstrin published
in 1941. In order to follow the intellectual development of potency-therapy
(vājīkaraṇa) in the Sanskrit medical literature, the remaining three extant major
commentaries are also translated from the existing printed editions. These three
commentaries are Cakrapāṇidatta’s Āyurvedadīpikā in the eleventh century,
Gaṅgādhara’s Jalpakalpataru in the mid-nineteenth century, and Yogīndranāth
Sen’s Carakopaskāra in the early-twentieth century.},
