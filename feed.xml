The international meeting was held using Zoom, with participants in India, the USA and Canada.</p> <p>The meeting discussed the collaboration between Dominik Wujastyk’s team and Maneesh Singhal’s group on the Suśruta project. Dominik’s team focuses on ancient Sanskrit manuscripts, while Maneesh’s team aims to establish a museum on Suśruta literature and develop a Suśruta research group.</p> <p>The research groups plan to exchange knowledge on surgical instruments, phytochemistry, and historical contexts. Maneesh’s team includes surgeons, biotechnologists, and ayurvedic physicians, and they will work on recreating Suśruta instruments and studying veterinary medicine. Future meetings will be held to coordinate efforts and share progress.</p> <p>Present:</p> <p>AIIMS group: Prof. Maneesh Singhal, Aanchal Sharma, Suttee, Samad, Arjun Ganguly, Manoj Kumar Jha, Shivani Gupta, Nandini Singh Tanwar.</p> <p>SS Project group: Prof. Dominik Wujastyk, Harshal Bhatt, Jason Birch, Lisa A. Brooks, Madhusudan Rimal, Tyler Neill.</p> <p><img src="/website/assets/img/2026-02-17-zoom-meeting-smaller.png" alt="Zoom meeting" width="50%"/></p> <p>The participants all introduced themselves, giving a thumbnail sketch of their respective interests in the projects.</p> <p>Prof. Singhal discussed his project on science and heritage research in India, aiming to establish a museum about Suśruta literature and develop a Suśruta research group. The museum will include artifacts, reconstructions of ancient surgical instruments, 3D printed materials, paintings, and a movie, funded by the government of India.</p> <p>Prof. Wujastyk discussed the old Nepalese manuscripts of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that have given us a window onto what the text looked like in the ninth century, and how it differed from what circulates today. Dr Brooks mentioned, as an example, the fact that the Nepalese version lists 21 surgical instruments while the contemporary printed editions mention only 20.</p> <p>The meeting concluded with expressions of gratitude and anticipation for future collaborations.</p> <p>References</p> <ul> <li>Suśruta Project websites: <a href="https://sushrutaproject1.github.io">https://sushrutaproject1.github.io</a> and <a href="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io">https://sushrutaproject2.github.io</a>.</li> <li>AIIMS Plastic Surgery department: <a href="https://www.aiims.edu/index.php/en/2016-11-08-08-48-51">https://www.aiims.edu/index.php/en/2016-11-08-08-48-51</a></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>Dominik Wujastyk</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[conversation about shared goals and possibilities for collaboration]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dhanvantari according to Gayadāsa – MS Cambridge CUL Add.2491</title><link href="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/blog/2026/Dhanvantari-again/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dhanvantari according to Gayadāsa – MS Cambridge CUL Add.2491"/><published>2026-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2026-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/blog/2026/Dhanvantari-again</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/blog/2026/Dhanvantari-again/"><![CDATA[<p>Jason has discovered a historically important statement in Gayadāsa’s commentary on the <em>Śārīrasthāna</em>.</p> <p>As mentioned in <a href="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2026/MS-Bikaner-Anup-4389/">yesterday’s blog post</a>, the <em><a href="https://panditproject.org/index.php/entity/108025/work">Nyāyacandrikā</a></em> by <a href="https://panditproject.org/index.php/entity/108024/person">Gayadāsa</a> (fl. ca. 1000, Bengal) is one of the important early commentaries on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>. It was discussed by Meulenbeld <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. 1A: 380-383)</a>.</p> <h2 id="gayadāsa-on-śārīrasthāna-12">Gayadāsa on Śārīrasthāna 1.2</h2> <p>Gayadāsa first discussed the title and opening statement of chapter 1 of the <em>Śārīrasthāna</em>. Then he came to the immediately following phrase “यथोवाच धन्वन्तरिः”, “as was declared by Dhanvantari,” which appears in almost all printed editions of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> and which has already been the subject of a paper from this project <a class="citation" href="#birc-2021">(Birch et al., 2021)</a>.</p> <p>While transcribing MS Bikaner Anup 4389, Jason noted the following statement by Gayadāsa:</p> <p><img src="/website/assets/img/ms-cambridge-add.2491-dhanvantari.png" alt="MS Bikaner Anup 4389" width="100%"/></p> <blockquote> <p>यथोवाच धन्वंतरिरिति प्रतिसंस्कर्तृसूत्रं॥</p> <p>“As Dhanvantari declared” is a statement by the editor.</p> </blockquote> <p>This deserves some unpacking. First, it is unexpected that Gayadāsa referred to the Dhanvantari phrase as a <em>sūtra</em>. This term usually refers to a laconic technical statement in a text such as Pāṇini’s grammar or the <em>Yogasūtra</em>, rather than a prose phrase. Second, is his use of the term प्रतिसंस्कर्ता “editor, reviser.” The term can be used to refer to someone who rewrites, edits or supplements an original text. In the context of medical literature, the most famous person referred to with this term is <a href="https://panditproject.org/index.php/entity/108545/person">Ḍṛḍhabala</a> (fl. ca. 300 CE) who, by his own admission, revised the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em> and actually wrote seventeen chapters of the <em>Cikitsāsthāna</em> and the whole of the <em>Kalpasthāna</em> and the <em>Siddhi</em> sections of that work <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. 1A: 130)</a>. Thus, it is quite a strong term to use, invoking the idea not of someone who makes minor changes, but of someone who may perform wholesale rewriting of a text.</p> <p>We have some reflections on the meaning of this term प्रतिसंस्कर्ता by the commentator Ḍalhaṇa. In his comments on the very opening of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, Ḍalhaṇa divided the statements of the work, which he called <em>sūtras</em>, into four categories: those of a reviser, of a partisan person, of a student or of a teacher <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938, p. 1)</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>ननु, कतमत्सूत्रमिदं? चतुर्विधानि हि सूत्राणि भवन्ति; तद्यथा- प्रतिसंस्कर्तृसूत्रम्, एकीयसूत्रं, शिष्यसूत्रं, गुरुसूत्रं चेति।</p> </blockquote> <p>Ḍalhaṇa noted that some people did not accept the existence of a reviser, while others did so. He went on to describe the role of such a reviser:</p> <blockquote> <p>किमेततत्स्वकपोलकल्पितं सुश्रुतेनोक्तम् , अथवा यथैव गुरुणोदीरितमिति पृष्टः प्रतिसंस्कर्ता सुश्रुतमुखेनेदमाह - यथोवाच भगवान् धन्वन्तरिरिति। इदं प्रतिसंस्कर्तृसूत्रं, यत्र यत्र परोक्षे लिट्प्रयोगस्तत्र तत्रैव प्रतिसंस्कर्तृसूत्रं ज्ञातव्यमिति; प्रतिसंस्कर्ताऽपीह नागार्जुन एव।</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>To the question, “Was this stated by Suśruta as something he made up by himself, or was it uttered by the preceptor [Divodāsa] exactly as it is?” the reviser, speaking through Suśruta’s mouth, replied: “As the Blessed (<em>bhagavān</em>) Dhanvantari spoke.” This is the reviser’s aphorism. Wherever the perfect tense is used to indicate an event not personally witnessed by the speaker, it should be recognized as a statement coming from the reviser. Furthermore, the reviser here is none other than Nāgārjuna.</p> </blockquote> <p>The verb उवाच “he spoke” in the phrase “Dhanvantari spoke,” is in the perfect tense, which in traditional sanskrit grammar is defined as being the past time that could not be witnessed (भूते, परोक्षे). This is why Ḍalhaṇa made this grammatical point. In his view, therefore, the language implies that the reviser is separated by a significant period of time from the author of the work. The reviser is answering an implied question: “is this medical treatise the work of the revered teacher Dhanvantari or is it the work of the human pupil Suśruta?”</p> <p>Thus we see that Ḍalhaṇa is again echoing a statement from Gayadāsa on this point. It is to be presumed that this whole discussion by Ḍalhaṇa is copied more or less from Gayadāsa’s <em>Nyāyacandrikā</em>. But unfortunately that part of the <em>Nyāyacandrikā</em> does not survive. It is particularly distressing that Gayadāsa’s own original remarks on this question of the different voices or registers in the text do not survive: it would have been be so interesting to know his views on this important topic in his own words.</p> <p>A remaining open question relates to Candraṭa (fl. ca. 900-1050). We presume that Candraṭa preceded Gayadāsa in time. Was Candraṭa the “reviser” that Gayadāsa had in mind? As mentioned in a previous blog, Ḍalhaṇa seems to have been unaware of Candraṭa.</p> <p>Finally, the identity of “medical” Nāgārjuna has been comprehensively discussed by Meulenbeld <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. 1A: 363–368)</a>. As Meulenbeld noted there,</p> <blockquote> <p>In my opinion it does not have much sense to engage in discusssions on the number of different Nāgārjunas to be distinguished. The large number of very diverse works ascribed to Nāgārjuna and the material relating to his life are in favour of the hypothesis that Nāgārjuna developed into a legendary figure, who was not only a philosopher, but also an alchemist and a colourful wizard, to whom all kinds of writings could be attributed by Buddhists, Hindus and Jains.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meulenbeld reflected further on the Nāgārjuna referred to by Ḍalhaṇa in the context of his remarks on the layers of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, but in spite of much scholarship on the topic, the issue remains inconclusive <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. 1A: 339-341)</a>.</p> <h2 id="appendix-surviving-portions-of-the-nyāyacandrikā">Appendix: Surviving portions of the Nyāyacandrikā</h2> <p>Very little of the <em>Nyāyacandrikā</em> survives.

I say “largely” because only a relatively small portion is known to have survived: the commentary on one of Suśruta’s six books, the <em>Nidānasthāna</em>, which was edited and published by Acharya Trivikramji in his 1938 edition of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938)</a>.</p> <p>We know that Gayadāsa’s commentary was important because it was frequently cited by Ḍalhaṇa, a twelfth-century author whose commentary came to define the version of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> that was printed and widely disseminated in the twentieth century. Since Ḍalhaṇa often refers to Gayadāsa’s views and records many variant readings known to this earlier commentator, it is clear that Gayadāsa played a significant role in the transmission and interpretation of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>.</p> <p>Given Gayadāsa’s importance to the history of <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, the existence of several unpublished manuscripts of the <em>Nyāyacandrikā</em> should be a priority for further research on the history of this medical tradition. For this reason, I was delighted to have the opportunity to read and transcribe Gayadāsa’s commentary on the second chapter of Suśruta’s <em>Sūtrasthāna</em>.</p> <p>My delight soon turned to anguish when I examined the sixteenth century manuscript <a href="https://panditproject.org/index.php/entity/108069/manuscript">Bikaner Anup 4389</a>, which is held by the Anup Sanskrit Library in the Lalgarh Palace, Bikaner. The most obvious problem was the frequent lacunae in the text, which the scribe represented with a dash for each syllable that was missing. It appears that the manuscript from which the scribe was copying had already been severely damaged, because several lines of dashes, sometimes numbering up to ten or twelve, appear on every folio. Each lacuna renders sentences, compounds, and words incomplete.</p> <p><img src="/website/assets/img/ms-anup-4389-folio.png" alt="MS Bikaner Anup 4389" width="100%"/></p> <p>Perhaps even more devastating than the lacunae, however, was the amount of gibberish spread throughout the text. Scholars who work with handwritten manuscripts of texts that have been poorly transmitted expect to encounter mistakes, and if these errors are small, they can usually be corrected so that the text can be understood, if not fully, then at least substantially. For editing purposes, one typically requires two or more manuscripts to correct a range of mistakes with some confidence.</p> <p>Unfortunately, manuscript Anup 4389 contains mistakes in every sentence, some of which a later hand has attempted to correct. Many letters have been crossed out and replaced with others written in the margin or above the line. These attempted corrections sometimes render the text even more illegible. When combined with the lacunae, the gibberish makes much of the manuscript incomprehensible. The difficulty of reading this manuscript (without another copy for comparison) is particularly evident in passages that correspond to Ḍalhaṇa’s commentary. In such instances, one can be more certain of what Gayadāsa originally wrote and therefore see the manuscript’s gibberish clearly. For example,</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Ḍalhaṇa</strong>:</td> <td>krodhaḥ parasyāpakārapūrvakaṃ hṛdayottejaḥ</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Gayadāsa</strong>:</td> <td>kovaḥ parasyatyakārapūrvikā haravitejaḥ</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In some cases, the manuscript reading is good enough to make sense of the text when read against Ḍalhaṇa’s parallel comment:</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Ḍalhaṇa</strong>:</td> <td>kāmaḥ viśiṣṭastrīviṣayasparśasaṅkalpaḥ, athavā śabdādiṣu grahaṇapravṛttirvā, svabāndhavakṛtasneho vā kāmaḥ</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Gayadāsa</strong>:</td> <td>tatra kāmo vi+ṣṭastriviṣayasparśaḥ prakalpaḥ athavā śabdādiṣu grahapratahir vā kāmo diṣva grahapravṛttisu vidyākūlaṃ</td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In other cases, however, the text is so corrupt that one cannot be certain that the passages are parallel:</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Ḍalhaṇa</strong>:</td> <td>lobhaḥ parasvagrahaṇecchā;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Gayadāsa</strong>:</td> <td>lātetharadhagrahā</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>I did not record the number of parallel passages between Gayadāsa and Ḍalhaṇa’s commentaries in the section I transcribed (and it would likely be more productive to do so with sections of the <em>Nidānasthāna</em>) but I was left with the impression that at least 20% of Gayadāsa’s commentary was close to Ḍalhaṇa’s. This suggests that Ḍalhaṇa tacitly borrowed material from Gayadāsa, in addition to the passages he explicitly attributed to him. In certain places, Gayadāsa’s commentary is more extensive, and Ḍalhaṇa seems to be summarising it. And in other places, Ḍalhaṇa expands on it.</p> <p>Although manuscript Anup 4389 is unlikely to ever serve as the sole basis for a critical edition and translation, it may be possible (albeit frustrating) to use it to identify parallels with Ḍalhaṇa. Such parallels may help to elucidate the extent to which this later commentator, whose work may appear largely original, was in fact redacting material from his predecessors.</p> <h3 id="references">References</h3> <ol class="bibliography"><li><div class="row"> <div id="susr-1938" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>श्रीडल्हणाचार्यविरचितया निबन्धसंग्रहाख्यव्याख्यया निदानस्थानस्य श्रीगयदासाचार्यविरचितया न्यायचन्द्रिकाख्यपञ्जिकाव्याख्यया च समुल्लसिता महर्षिणा सुश्रुतेन विरचिता सुश्रुतसंहिता</em></div> <div class="author"> Yādavaśarma Trivikrama Ācārya and Nārāyaṇa Rāma Ācārya </div> <div class="periodical"> 1938 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="http://ark.archive.org/ark:/13960/s20j9338vs3" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol>]]></content><author><name>Jason Birch</name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="SuśrutaProject"/><category term="gayadāsa"/><category term="transcription"/><category term="gibberish"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An account of transcribing chapter 2 of Gayadāsa's commentary on Sūtrasthāna in MS Bikaner Anup 4389 (Anup Sanskrit Library, Bikaner) .]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Project publication - Lisa A.

Perhaps the earliest detailed description of this interaction is found in a chapter on leech therapy from an early first-millennium Sanskrit surgical treatise, the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>. There we find descriptions of how humans should classify, care for, interpret, and interact with leeches in medical practice. This article contributes to our understanding of leech therapy in South Asia broadly and to the textual history of this important medical treatise through a comparative study of a newly generated “Nepalese version” of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>’s chapter “On Leeches” together with the most widely cited version (Āchārya 1938) that was published with Ḍalhaṇa’s twelfth-century commentary.

In the vulgate version, the passage reads <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938, p. 338)</a>:</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>tad ekam anekeṣāṃ kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānaṃ samudra <strong>ivaudakanāṃ</strong> bhāvānām</td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>That One is the foundation of the many Witnesses, just like the ocean for aquatic (audaka) beings.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Nepalese witnesses N and H both read <strong>ivodakaujasāṃ</strong> “for beings who have water as their energy (<em>ojas</em>).” This is an unusual use of the word <em>ojas</em> and the meaning of the simile is not clear.</p> <p>Philipp Maas, project collaborator (<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1451-9439">ORCID</a>), was able to suggest a compelling solution to this conundrum.</p> <h2 id="reflections-philipp-maas">Reflections (Philipp Maas)</h2> <p>Following our online meeting, the illustration in Śā 1.3 continued to puzzle me. Even if the phrase <em>tad ekam anekeṣāṃ kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānaṃ samudra ivodakaujasāṃ bhāvānām</em> makes some sense, it is hardly correct because the technical term -<em>ojas</em> as a final part of a bahuvrīhi compound does not fit the context. It remains unclear what kind of entities or beings could be described as “having water as their power” and how such a characterisation can be understood in a comparison (which should be clear without specialist knowledge) of the role of <em>avyakta</em> for the <em>kṣetrejña</em>s.</p> <p>In this situation, an editor could either mark the edited text as corrupt or suggest an emendation. However, my suggestion to read <em>ivodakajānāṃ</em> instead of <em>ivodakaujasāṃ</em> was unsatisfactory because there is no reason why the unobjectionable and easy reading <em>ivodakajānāṃ</em> could be changed in the course of the transmission into the more difficult but apparently incorrect <em>ivodakaujasāṃ</em> in the Nepalese version. I have now found a better solution to this problem and propose a different emendation, namely to emend <em>udakaujasāṃ</em> to <em>udakaukasāṃ</em> “having water as their house or habitat, living in water, aquatic,” which involves the change of the single akṣara <em>ja</em> to <em>ka</em>, making <em>okas</em> out of <em>ojas</em>.</p> <p>Admittedly, I have not yet been able to detect an occurrence of the word <em>udakaukas</em> in Sanskrit literature, but <em>jalaukas</em> is quite common, meaning “leech” or “aquatic being” as, for example, in MBh 12.195.22: <em>śubhāśubhaṃ karma kṛtaṃ yad asya tad eva pratyādadate svadehe / mano ‘nuvartanti parāvarāṇi jalaukasaḥ srota ivānukūlam</em> // (22.2). Since <em>jalaukas</em> is a substantivised adjective, nothing prevents the usage of the parallel formation <em>udakaukas</em> as a bahuvrīhi meaning “aquatic.”</p> <p>The passage</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>tad ekam anekeṣāṃ kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānaṃ samudra ivodakaukasāṃ bhāvānām</td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>would then translate as</p> <blockquote> <p>This is the single abode of the multiple Selves (“knowers of the field”) like the ocean for aquatic beings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Emending the text from <em>ivodakaujasāṃ bhāvānām</em> to <em>ivodakaukasāṃ bhāvānām</em> satisfies both requirements of emendations.</p> <ul> <li>First, the emendation resolves the issue of meaning. The <em>dṛṣṭānta</em> compares the single <em>avyakta</em> in which multiple Selves lead their existences with the single ocean, in which multiple aquatic animals exist.</li> <li>Moreover, it is possible to explain how the textual corruption occurred in the Nepalese version. A scribe, who did not follow the text or who was unfamiliar with the word <em>okas</em> as a final part of a compound, wrongly corrected what he saw as a scribal error in his exemplar from -<em>aukasāṃ</em> to -<em>aujasāṃ</em>. This scenario is especially probable if one considers the similarity between ja (𑐖) and ka (𑐎) in some Nepalese scripts (see, for example, these characters in the <a href="http://www.fanfoyan.com/resour/pale/saddharma.pdf"><em>Saddharmapuṇḍarīka</em> ms. dated to 1082</a> and the <a href="https://fanfoyan.com/resour/pale/buddhapalita.pdf">Mūlamadhyamakakārikā ms. dated to 550-650</a>).</li> </ul> <p>As is the case with all emendations, there is no way to attain certainty, except by consulting new manuscript materials. However, one should keep in mind that in the course of the transmission from the earliest examples of Suśruta’s to the Nepalese version, scribal errors will definitely have occurred, which will make minor amendments necessary here and there to reach a satisfactory text.</p> <ol class="bibliography"><li><div class="row"> <div id="susr-1938" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>श्रीडल्हणाचार्यविरचितया निबन्धसंग्रहाख्यव्याख्यया निदानस्थानस्य श्रीगयदासाचार्यविरचितया न्यायचन्द्रिकाख्यपञ्जिकाव्याख्यया च समुल्लसिता महर्षिणा सुश्रुतेन विरचिता सुश्रुतसंहिता</em></div> <div class="author"> Yādavaśarma Trivikrama Ācārya and Nārāyaṇa Rāma Ācārya </div> <div class="periodical"> 1938 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="http://ark.archive.org/ark:/13960/s20j9338vs3" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol>]]></content><author><name>Philipp Maas</name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="SuśrutaProject"/><category term="manuscripts"/><category term="variant"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thought process about emending]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Book review of “Plastic Surgery”</title><link href="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/blog/2025/review-of-project-book/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Book review of “Plastic Surgery”"/><published>2025-09-20T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-20T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/blog/2025/review-of-project-book</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/blog/2025/review-of-project-book/"><![CDATA[<p>In 2023, the Suśruta Project published an open-access monograph entitled, <em>On the Plastic Surgery of the Ears and Nose: The Nepalese Version of the “Suśrutasaṃhitā”</em> (Heidelberg: Heidelberg Asian Studies Publishing), https://doi.org/10.11588/hasp.1203.</p> <p>A book review by Prof. Martha Selby (Harvard) has recently been published in the journal <em>Asian Medicine</em>.

This is the case, for example, with MS Bikaner Anup 4391, that was reported in this way in NCC <a class="citation" href="#ncc">(<i>New Catalogus Catalogorum, An Alphabetical Register of Sanskrit and Allied Works and Authors</i>, 2015, pp. 7: 317)</a>. This led Meulenbeld to assert the existence of a manuscript of a commentary by Jejjaṭa on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. 1B 506 n.360)</a>. In fact, MS Bikaner Anup 4391 is the text of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, with the Candraṭa verse in the colophon. It is likely that this is the same case for MS London IOLR Taylor 1842: this is currently being investigated, but which initially seems to be a manuscript supporting the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> with the commentary of Ḍalhaṇa, but nothing by the author Candraṭa.</p> <p>MSS currently known to have the so-called Candraṭa verse:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/108211/manuscript">MS Bikaner Anup 4391</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108178/manuscript">MS London IOLR Taylor 1842</a> (Eggeling catalogue 2646)</li> <li><a href="https://www.panditproject.org/entity/113349/manuscript">MS Kurukṣetra Jawaharlal Nehru Library 19786</a>, f. 78v</li> <li><a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/108634/manuscript">MS Los Angeles LACMA M.87.271c (ma-44977.tiff)</a></li> <li><a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/109395/manuscript">MS Kolkata ASB G. 5275</a>, part III (according to the catalogue)</li> <li><a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/108192/manuscript">MS Udaipur RORI Udaipur coll. 1806(3)</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="testimonia">Testimonia</h3> <p>There are also numerous statements in the secondary literature asserting that commentators cite Jejjaṭa’s commentary on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>. For example, the NCC (idem) names Hemādri, Vijayarakṣita, Ṭoḍarānanda, Nāganātha, and Rūpanayana, to which Meulenbeld added Ḍalhaṇa, Gayadāsa and Niścalakara (ibid, v. 1A, p. 385). Some of these may indeed be concrete evidence for a commentary on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> by Jejjaṭa. They need to be studied individually, especially those of Ḍalhaṇa and Niścalakara.</p> <h4 id="indus-commentary-on-the-aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha">Indu’s commentary on the <em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha</em></h4> <p>D. C. Bhattacharyya <a class="citation" href="#bhat-1947">(Bhattacharyya, 1947, pp. 112, note 1)</a> stated of Rudrapāraśara’s early edition of the <em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha</em> with the commentary <em>Śaśilekhā</em> by <a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/40853/person">Indu</a> <a class="citation" href="#rudr-1924">(Rudrapāraśava, 1924)</a>, that,</p> <blockquote> <p>The editor [Rudrapāraśara] had to rely on imperfect and fragmentary Mss. of the Śaśilekhā. But, … he filled up a lacuna in the Śaśilekhā with the text of the Nirantarapadī commentary (on Suśruta) by Jarjaṭa (vol. II, p. 298), which seems to be quite accessible to him, though it is a sealed book to the world outside. Many notes from Jarjaṭa [Jejjaṭa] have been printed in vols II and III.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The passage on p. 298 of Rudrapāraśara’s edition reads as follows:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Rudrapāraśara 1924, v.2, p.298." loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> द्रोणेऽम्भस इतयारभ्य श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्येत्यन्तग्रन्थस्य शशिलेखाया अदर्शनात् जर्जटकृता निरन्तरपदी व्याख्या लिख्यते । द्रोणेऽम्भस इत्यादि । जीवनीयैः जीवन्त्यादिभिर्महाकषायसङ्ग्रहोक्तैर् दशभिः । फल्गुर्गोष्ठोदुम्बरः ॥ Because the *Śaśilekhā* is unavailable starting from the passage "द्रोणेऽम्भस" [As.ci.23.40] and ending with the passage "श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्य" [As.ci.23.61], a commentary Nirantarapadī, composed by Jarjaṭa, is written. … </div> </div> <p>This is an interesting passage, but both of Bhattacharyya’s assertions about it are probably wrong. One has to ask, “whose voice is this commentarial statement?” It is impossible that Indu (fl. ca. 1000–1150) would have referred to his own commentary by name, saying that it was incomplete. It is also unlikely that it was Rudrapāraśara, in the 1920s. The passage is printed in the same size and font as the rest of the text of the <em>Śaśilekhā</em>. By contrast, p. 300 shows the typography of an editorial comment from Rudrapāraśara himself:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Rudrapāraśara 1924, v.2, p.300." loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> As we see, the text prints the editor’s footnote to the text with an asterisk and a different font (p. 300, with two references to Jarjaṭa). Note, too, the reference to the Carakasaṃhitā (चरकपाठः). </div> </div> <p>As suggested by Deepro Chakraborty (personal communication), it is more likely that the passage printed in the book is what Rudrapāraśara saw in his source, namely the <em>manuscript</em> of Indu’s commentary. Therefore, the comment would be that of a scribe who produced the manuscript that Rudrapāraśara was reading. This would be a scribal insertion, perhaps from the margin of the archetype of Rudrapāraśara’s manuscript, responding to physical damage to the manuscript, that had migrated into the body of the main text during the next copying. This is a common feature of manuscript transmission. It may be possible to check this, if one can find the manuscript from which Rudrapāraśara was working.</p> <p>Regarding Bhattacharyya’s second assertion, there is nothing in this passage to suggest that Rudrapāraśara had access to a commentary by Jejjaṭa’s on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> On the contrary, the name <em>Nirantarapadī</em> is an abbreviation of the name of Jejjaṭa’s commentary on the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em>, i.e., “<em>Nirantarapadavyākhyā</em>” <a class="citation" href="#zysk-2019">(Zysk &amp; Yamashita, 2019; Sastry &amp; Pandey, 1975)</a>. Further, on p. 300 (above) there is an explicit reference to the version of the passage under discussion as it appears in the text of the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em> (चरकपाठे).</p> <p>Other passages in the <em>Śaśilekhā</em> that require study because they refer to Jejjaṭa include Ni.2.3, Ci.9.50 and 51-52, Utt.30.79 and 80, 38.2-6a <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. 1A: 670)</a></p> <p>While I criticize Bhattacharyya’s assertions above, his 1947 paper was nevertheless a landmark contribution to medical history. He published much valid historical and prosopographical information for the first time through his extremely close reading of the sources.</p> <p>A minor complicating factor is that the 1980 edition of the <em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha</em> edited by Āṭhavale prints the same passage word-for-word the same as in Rudrapāraśara’s edition <a class="citation" href="#atha-1980">(Āṭhavale, 1980, pp. 557-558)</a>. The most likely explanation is that Āṭhavale was simply reproducing Rudrapāraśara’s edition without thought at this point. (A print example of the scribal mechanism described above!) Āṭhavale was fully aware of the earlier edition and frames his own edition as being necessary because Rudrapāraśara’s edition had gone out of print. Only a fresh examination of the manuscripts will clear up this point.</p> <p>In any case, those passages that I have examined from Indu on the <em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha</em> are from Jejjaṭa on the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em>, not the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>. Further study is required to clarify and clarify this.</p> <p>[Later edit:</p> <p>Prof. Tsutomu Yamashita noted in an email (2025-09-06) that in his commentary on the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em>, Jejjaṭa several times referred to the <em>Suśrtasaṃhitā</em>. The following passage illustrates such citations:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Jejjaṭa on Caraka</th> <th>Suśruta passage cited</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Cikitsāsthāna 3</td> <td>Uttaratantra 39</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cikitsāsthāna 24.199–205</td> <td>Uttaratantra 47.49</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>This internal evidence from Jejjaṭa’s own writing shows that he was certainly aware of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> and referred to it. But this does not prove that he wrote a commentary on it.</p> <p>At the time of writing, the fact that Ḍalhaṇa and others apparently cite Jejjaṭa while writing on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, and that Candraṭa said his revisions to the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> were made after studying Jejjaṭa, make it likely that there was once a commentary by Jejjaṭa on that text. However, the commentary is lost and the manuscripts that have been cited as containing parts of the commentary do not do so.</p> <p>Ḍalhaṇa’s references to Jejjaṭa will be collected in a separate post.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li><div class="row"> <div id="bhat-1947" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>Date and Works of Vāgbhaṭa the Physician</em></div> <div class="author"> Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharyya </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute</em>, 1947 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44028048" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li><div class="row"> <div id="meul-hist" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>A History of Indian Medical Literature</em></div> <div class="author"> Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld </div> <div class="periodical"> 1999 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="http://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t4qk6558q" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li><div class="row"> <div id="ncc" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>New Catalogus Catalogorum, An Alphabetical Register of Sanskrit and Allied Works and Authors</em></div> <div class="author"> V.

This commentary is incomplete, but sufficient portions survive to allow a study of the earliest form of medical commentary in India. The extant portions of this commentary are large sections of the Cikitsāsthāna and part of the Kalpasthāna and Siddhisthāna. The text of Nirantarapadavyākhyā by Jajjaṭa has never been critically edited. In this paper, we present a text-critical edition and translation of the Nirantarapadavyākhyā on the Carakasaṃhitā, Cikitsāsthāna Chapter 2, Quarter 1 (CaCi 2.1) based on several copies of a lost palm-leaf manuscript in Malayalam script and the printed edition by Haridatta Śāstrin published in 1941. In order to follow the intellectual development of potency-therapy (vājīkaraṇa) in the Sanskrit medical literature, the remaining three extant major commentaries are also translated from the existing printed editions. These three commentaries are Cakrapāṇidatta’s Āyurvedadīpikā in the eleventh century, Gaṅgādhara’s Jalpakalpataru in the mid-nineteenth century, and Yogīndranāth Sen’s Carakopaskāra in the early-twentieth century.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li><div class="row"> <div id="atha-1980" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgrahaḥ.

The breadth and accuracy of his citations tells us that he had an excellent personal library.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sharma-1992-page-645-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sharma-1992-page-645-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sharma-1992-page-645-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/sharma-1992-page-645.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Sharma 1992, p.645." loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> In his discussion of a recipe for treating skin diseases and ringworm, Kuṣṭhacikitsā, 48: 34 <a class="citation" href="#shar-1993">(Sharma, 1993, p. 645)</a>, he appears to have distinguished the “version of Candraṭa" (चन्द्रटपाठ) from the standard text (सुश्रुतपाठ). Niścalakara said that the "version of Candraṭa" read as follows: <br/> लाक्षा कुष्ठं सर्षपाः श्रीनिकेतं रात्रिव्योषं चक्रमर्दस्य बीजम् । कृत्वैकस्थं तक्रपिष्टं प्रलेपो दद्रूषूक्तो मूलकं बीजयुक्तः || <br/> This corresponds almost exactly with the published vulgate text of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* on 4.9.12 <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938, p. 443)</a>. </div> </div> <p>The Nepalese version, however, is somewhat different in phrasing, though more or less identical in meaning:</p> <blockquote> <p>श्रीवेष्टकुष्ठं कुटजं सर्षपा लाक्षा व्योषं प्रपुनाटस्य बीजं। तक्रेण पिष्टः सहरिद्रलेपो दद्द्रूषूक्तो मूलकाबीजयुक्तः ।</p> </blockquote> <p>Niścalakara was exercised to point out that this recipe (in both Suśruta versions) does not contain विडङ्ग (embelia) as does the <em>Cakradatta</em> version of this recipe. But he also pointed out that in some places in the “version of Suśruta” the plant गुग्गुलु (Indian bdellium-tree) is read (as it is in the <em>Cakradatta</em>). We do not see Suśruta manuscripts with this reading. He also pointed out that all sources agree about the inclusion of buttermilk in the recipe and for this reason it should should be included, even though the <em>Cakradatta</em> does not mention it. The way that Niścalakara refers to “all sources” (<em>सर्वत्र</em>) appears to refer to the two versions of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> that he is distinguishing, that of Candraṭa and the “version of Suśruta.” Thus, in twelfth century Bengal, it seems that Niścalakara was aware of two versions of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> and distinguished between them in his interpretation of recipes.</p> <p>We are beginning the work of examining the MSS that apparently transmit Candraṭa’s this work, but the suspicion is growing that in fact Candraṭa did not write a <em>separate work</em> with this title. Rather, he produced a <em>version</em> of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> that specifically adhered to the opinions of the commentator Jejjaṭa. The manuscripts we are seeing with the verse cited above are the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, not some commentary on it.</p> <p>This would cast Candraṭa as a scholar who produced a new version of the whole <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, one that specifically accepted the readings of the earlier commentator Jejjaṭa.</p> <p>The commentator Ḍalhaṇa does not mention Candraṭa’s name anywhere in his extensive commentary. He is elsewhere not shy about citing predecessors, so we deduce that he was not aware of Candraṭa’s work.</p> <p>At present, this is a hypothesis, and our project members are discussing the issue and thinking of ways to test the hypothesis.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li><div class="row"> <div id="egge-1887" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>Catalogue of the Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Library of the India Office.
