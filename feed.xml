I say “largely” because only a relatively small portion is known to have survived: the commentary on one of Suśruta’s six books, the <em>Nidānasthāna</em>, which was edited and published by Acharya Trivikramji in his 1938 edition of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938)</a>.</p> <p>We know that Gayadāsa’s commentary was important because it was frequently cited by Ḍalhaṇa, a twelfth-century author whose commentary came to define the version of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> that was printed and widely disseminated in the twentieth century. Since Ḍalhaṇa often refers to Gayadāsa’s views and records many variant readings known to this earlier commentator, it is clear that Gayadāsa played a significant role in the transmission and interpretation of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>.</p> <p>Given Gayadāsa’s importance to the history of <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, the existence of several unpublished manuscripts of the <em>Nyāyacandrikā</em> should be a priority for further research on the history of this medical tradition. For this reason, I was delighted to have the opportunity to read and transcribe Gayadāsa’s commentary on the second chapter of Suśruta’s <em>Sūtrasthāna</em>.</p> <p>My delight soon turned to anguish when I examined manuscript Bikaner Anup 4389, which is held by the Anup Sanskrit Library in the Lalgarh Palace, Bikaner. The most obvious problem was the frequent lacunae in the text, which the scribe represented with a dash for each syllable that was missing. It appears that the manuscript from which the scribe was copying had already been severely damaged, because several lines of dashes, sometimes numbering up to ten or twelve, appear on every folio. Each lacuna renders sentences, compounds, and words incomplete.</p> <p><img src="/website/assets/img/ms-anup-4389-folio.png" alt="MS Bikaner Anup 4389" width="90%"/></p> <p>Perhaps even more devastating than the lacunae, however, was the amount of gibberish spread throughout the text. Scholars who work with handwritten manuscripts of texts that have been poorly transmitted expect to encounter mistakes, and if these errors are small, they can usually be corrected so that the text can be understand, if not fully, then at least substantially. For editing purposes, one typically requires two or more manuscripts to correct a range of mistakes with some confidence.</p> <p>Unfortunately, manuscript Anup 4389 contains mistakes in every sentence, some of which a later hand has attempted to correct. Many letters have been crossed out and replaced with others written in the margin or above the line. These attempted corrections sometimes render the text even more illegible. When combined with the lacunae, the gibberish makes much of the manuscript incomprehensible. The difficulty of reading this manuscript (without another copy for comparison) is particularly evident in passages that correspond to Ḍalhaṇa’s commentary. In such instances, one can be more certain of what Gayadāsa originally wrote and therefore see the manuscript’s gibberish clearly. For example,</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Ḍalhaṇa</strong>: krodhaḥ parasyāpakārapūrvakaṃ hṛdayottejaḥ</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Gayadāsa</strong>: kovaḥ parasyatyakārapūrvikā haravitejaḥ</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>In some cases, the manuscript reading is good enough to make sense of the text when read against Ḍalhaṇa’s parallel comment:</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Ḍalhaṇa</strong>: kāmaḥ viśiṣṭastrīviṣayasparśasaṅkalpaḥ, athavā śabdādiṣu grahaṇapravṛttirvā, svabāndhavakṛtasneho vā kāmaḥ</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>Gayadāsa</strong>: tatra kāmo vi+ṣṭastriviṣayasparśaḥ prakalpaḥ athavā śabdādiṣu grahapratahir vā kāmo diṣva grahapravṛttisu vidyākūlaṃ</p> </blockquote> <p>In other cases, however, the text is so corrupt that one cannot be certain that the passages are parallel:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Ḍalhaṇa</strong>: lobhaḥ parasvagrahaṇecchā; <strong>Gayadāsa</strong>: lātetharadhagrahā</p> </blockquote> <p>I did not record the number of parallel passages between Gayadāsa and Ḍalhaṇa’s commentaries in the section I transcribed (and it would likely be more productive to do so with sections of the <em>Nidānasthāna</em>) but I was left with the impression that at least 20% of Gayadāsa’s commentary was close to Ḍalhaṇa’s. This suggests that Ḍalhaṇa tacitly borrowed material from Gayadāsa, in addition to the passages he explicitly attributed to him. In certain places, Gayadāsa’s commentary is more extensive, and Ḍalhaṇa seems to be summarising it. And in other places, Ḍalhaṇa expands on it.</p> <p>Although manuscript Anup 4389 is unlikely to ever serve as the sole basis for a critical edition and translation, it may be possible (albeit frustrating) to use it to identify parallels with Ḍalhaṇa. Such parallels may help to elucidate the extent to which this later commentator, whose work may appear largely original, was in fact redacting material from his predecessors.</p> <h3 id="references">References</h3> <ol class="bibliography"><li><div class="row"> <div id="susr-1938" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>श्रीडल्हणाचार्यविरचितया निबन्धसंग्रहाख्यव्याख्यया निदानस्थानस्य श्रीगयदासाचार्यविरचितया न्यायचन्द्रिकाख्यपञ्जिकाव्याख्यया च समुल्लसिता महर्षिणा सुश्रुतेन विरचिता सुश्रुतसंहिता</em></div> <div class="author"> Yādavaśarma Trivikrama Ācārya and Nārāyaṇa Rāma Ācārya </div> <div class="periodical"> 1938 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="http://ark.archive.org/ark:/13960/s20j9338vs3" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol>]]></content><author><name>Jason Birch</name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="SuśrutaProject"/><category term="gayadāsa"/><category term="transcription"/><category term="gibberish"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An account of transcribing chapter 2 of Gayadāsa's commentary on Sūtrasthāna in MS Bikaner Anup 4389 (Anup Sanskrit Library, Bikaner) .]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Text Emendation - Dwellers in the Sea</title><link href="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/dwellers-in-the-sea/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Text Emendation - Dwellers in the Sea"/><published>2025-09-20T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-20T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/dwellers-in-the-sea</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/dwellers-in-the-sea/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction-dominik-wujastyk">Introduction (Dominik Wujastyk)</h2> <p>The following post illustrates the creative philological process that can lead to an emendation to a text in spite of the transmitted readings of the manuscript witnesses.</p> <p>During an online reading seminar, we were puzzled by the Nepalese manuscript readings of passage SS 3.1.3. In the vulgate version, the passage reads <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938, p. 338)</a>:</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>tad ekam anekeṣāṃ kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānaṃ samudra <strong>ivaudakanāṃ</strong> bhāvānām</td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>That One is the foundation of the many Witnesses, just like the ocean for aquatic (audaka) beings.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Nepalese witnesses N and H both read <strong>ivodakaujasāṃ</strong> “for beings who have water as their energy (<em>ojas</em>).” This is an unusual use of the word <em>ojas</em> and the meaning of the simile is not clear.</p> <p>Philipp Maas, project collaborator (<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1451-9439">ORCID</a>), was able to suggest a compelling solution to this conundrum.</p> <h2 id="reflections-philipp-maas">Reflections (Philipp Maas)</h2> <p>Following our online meeting, the illustration in Śā 1.3 continued to puzzle me. Even if the phrase <em>tad ekam anekeṣāṃ kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānaṃ samudra ivodakaujasāṃ bhāvānām</em> makes some sense, it is hardly correct because the technical term -<em>ojas</em> as a final part of a bahuvrīhi compound does not fit the context. It remains unclear what kind of entities or beings could be described as “having water as their power” and how such a characterisation can be understood in a comparison (which should be clear without specialist knowledge) of the role of <em>avyakta</em> for the <em>kṣetrejña</em>s.</p> <p>In this situation, an editor could either mark the edited text as corrupt or suggest an emendation. However, my suggestion to read <em>ivodakajānāṃ</em> instead of <em>ivodakaujasāṃ</em> was unsatisfactory because there is no reason why the unobjectionable and easy reading <em>ivodakajānāṃ</em> could be changed in the course of the transmission into the more difficult but apparently incorrect <em>ivodakaujasāṃ</em> in the Nepalese version. I have now found a better solution to this problem and propose a different emendation, namely to emend <em>udakaujasāṃ</em> to <em>udakaukasāṃ</em> “having water as their house or habitat, living in water, aquatic,” which involves the change of the single akṣara <em>ja</em> to <em>ka</em>, making <em>okas</em> out of <em>ojas</em>.</p> <p>Admittedly, I have not yet been able to detect an occurrence of the word <em>udakaukas</em> in Sanskrit literature, but <em>jalaukas</em> is quite common, meaning “leech” or “aquatic being” as, for example, in MBh 12.195.22: <em>śubhāśubhaṃ karma kṛtaṃ yad asya tad eva pratyādadate svadehe / mano ‘nuvartanti parāvarāṇi jalaukasaḥ srota ivānukūlam</em> // (22.2). Since <em>jalaukas</em> is a substantivised adjective, nothing prevents the usage of the parallel formation <em>udakaukas</em> as a bahuvrīhi meaning “aquatic.”</p> <p>The passage</p> <blockquote> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>tad ekam anekeṣāṃ kṣetrajñānām adhiṣṭhānaṃ samudra ivodakaukasāṃ bhāvānām</td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </blockquote> <p>would then translate as</p> <blockquote> <p>This is the single abode of the multiple Selves (“knowers of the field”) like the ocean for aquatic beings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Emending the text from <em>ivodakaujasāṃ bhāvānām</em> to <em>ivodakaukasāṃ bhāvānām</em> satisfies both requirements of emendations.</p> <ul> <li>First, the emendation resolves the issue of meaning. The <em>dṛṣṭānta</em> compares the single <em>avyakta</em> in which multiple Selves lead their existences with the single ocean, in which multiple aquatic animals exist.</li> <li>Moreover, it is possible to explain how the textual corruption occurred in the Nepalese version. A scribe, who did not follow the text or who was unfamiliar with the word <em>okas</em> as a final part of a compound, wrongly corrected what he saw as a scribal error in his exemplar from -<em>aukasāṃ</em> to -<em>aujasāṃ</em>. This scenario is especially probable if one considers the similarity between ja (𑐖) and ka (𑐎) in some Nepalese scripts (see, for example, these characters in the <a href="http://www.fanfoyan.com/resour/pale/saddharma.pdf"><em>Saddharmapuṇḍarīka</em> ms. dated to 1082</a> and the <a href="https://fanfoyan.com/resour/pale/buddhapalita.pdf">Mūlamadhyamakakārikā ms. dated to 550-650</a>).</li> </ul> <p>As is the case with all emendations, there is no way to attain certainty, except by consulting new manuscript materials. However, one should keep in mind that in the course of the transmission from the earliest examples of Suśruta’s to the Nepalese version, scribal errors will definitely have occurred, which will make minor amendments necessary here and there to reach a satisfactory text.</p> <ol class="bibliography"><li><div class="row"> <div id="susr-1938" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>श्रीडल्हणाचार्यविरचितया निबन्धसंग्रहाख्यव्याख्यया निदानस्थानस्य श्रीगयदासाचार्यविरचितया न्यायचन्द्रिकाख्यपञ्जिकाव्याख्यया च समुल्लसिता महर्षिणा सुश्रुतेन विरचिता सुश्रुतसंहिता</em></div> <div class="author"> Yādavaśarma Trivikrama Ācārya and Nārāyaṇa Rāma Ācārya </div> <div class="periodical"> 1938 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="http://ark.archive.org/ark:/13960/s20j9338vs3" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol>]]></content><author><name>Philipp Maas</name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="SuśrutaProject"/><category term="manuscripts"/><category term="variant"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thought process about emending]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Book review of “Plastic Surgery”</title><link href="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/review-of-project-book/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Book review of “Plastic Surgery”"/><published>2025-09-20T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-20T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/review-of-project-book</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/review-of-project-book/"><![CDATA[<p>In 2023, the Suśruta Project published an open-access monograph entitled, <em>On the Plastic Surgery of the Ears and Nose: The Nepalese Version of the “Suśrutasaṃhitā”</em> (Heidelberg: Heidelberg Asian Studies Publishing), https://doi.org/10.11588/hasp.1203.</p> <p>A book review by Prof. Martha Selby (Harvard) has recently been published in the journal <em>Asian Medicine</em>.

This is the case, for example, with MS Bikaner Anup 4391, that was reported in this way in NCC <a class="citation" href="#ncc">(<i>New Catalogus Catalogorum, An Alphabetical Register of Sanskrit and Allied Works and Authors</i>, 2015, pp. 7: 317)</a>. This led Meulenbeld to assert the existence of a manuscript of a commentary by Jejjaṭa on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. 1B 506 n.360)</a>. In fact, MS Bikaner Anup 4391 is the text of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, with the Candraṭa verse in the colophon. It is likely that this is the same case for MS London IOLR Taylor 1842: this is currently being investigated, but which initially seems to be a manuscript supporting the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> with the commentary of Ḍalhaṇa, but nothing by the author Candraṭa.</p> <p>MSS currently known to have the so-called Candraṭa verse:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/108211/manuscript">MS Bikaner Anup 4391</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108178/manuscript">MS London IOLR Taylor 1842</a> (Eggeling catalogue 2646)</li> <li><a href="https://www.panditproject.org/entity/113349/manuscript">MS Kurukṣetra Jawaharlal Nehru Library 19786</a>, f. 78v</li> <li><a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/108634/manuscript">MS Los Angeles LACMA M.87.271c (ma-44977.tiff)</a></li> <li><a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/109395/manuscript">MS Kolkata ASB G. 5275</a>, part III (according to the catalogue)</li> <li><a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/108192/manuscript">MS Udaipur RORI Udaipur coll. 1806(3)</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="testimonia">Testimonia</h3> <p>There are also numerous statements in the secondary literature asserting that commentators cite Jejjaṭa’s commentary on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>. For example, the NCC (idem) names Hemādri, Vijayarakṣita, Ṭoḍarānanda, Nāganātha, and Rūpanayana, to which Meulenbeld added Ḍalhaṇa, Gayadāsa and Niścalakara (ibid, v. 1A, p. 385). Some of these may indeed be concrete evidence for a commentary on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> by Jejjaṭa. They need to be studied individually, especially those of Ḍalhaṇa and Niścalakara.</p> <h4 id="indus-commentary-on-the-aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha">Indu’s commentary on the <em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha</em></h4> <p>D. C. Bhattacharyya <a class="citation" href="#bhat-1947">(Bhattacharyya, 1947, pp. 112, note 1)</a> stated of Rudrapāraśara’s early edition of the <em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha</em> with the commentary <em>Śaśilekhā</em> by <a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/40853/person">Indu</a> <a class="citation" href="#rudr-1924">(Rudrapāraśava, 1924)</a>, that,</p> <blockquote> <p>The editor [Rudrapāraśara] had to rely on imperfect and fragmentary Mss. of the Śaśilekhā. But, … he filled up a lacuna in the Śaśilekhā with the text of the Nirantarapadī commentary (on Suśruta) by Jarjaṭa (vol. II, p. 298), which seems to be quite accessible to him, though it is a sealed book to the world outside. Many notes from Jarjaṭa [Jejjaṭa] have been printed in vols II and III.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The passage on p. 298 of Rudrapāraśara’s edition reads as follows:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/website/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298-480.webp 480w,/website/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298-800.webp 800w,/website/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/website/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-298.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Rudrapāraśara 1924, v.2, p.298." loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> द्रोणेऽम्भस इतयारभ्य श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्येत्यन्तग्रन्थस्य शशिलेखाया अदर्शनात् जर्जटकृता निरन्तरपदी व्याख्या लिख्यते । द्रोणेऽम्भस इत्यादि । जीवनीयैः जीवन्त्यादिभिर्महाकषायसङ्ग्रहोक्तैर् दशभिः । फल्गुर्गोष्ठोदुम्बरः ॥ Because the *Śaśilekhā* is unavailable starting from the passage "द्रोणेऽम्भस" [As.ci.23.40] and ending with the passage "श्वदंष्ट्रककषायस्य" [As.ci.23.61], a commentary Nirantarapadī, composed by Jarjaṭa, is written. … </div> </div> <p>This is an interesting passage, but both of Bhattacharyya’s assertions about it are probably wrong. One has to ask, “whose voice is this commentarial statement?” It is impossible that Indu (fl. ca. 1000–1150) would have referred to his own commentary by name, saying that it was incomplete. It is also unlikely that it was Rudrapāraśara, in the 1920s. The passage is printed in the same size and font as the rest of the text of the <em>Śaśilekhā</em>. By contrast, p. 300 shows the typography of an editorial comment from Rudrapāraśara himself:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/website/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300-480.webp 480w,/website/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300-800.webp 800w,/website/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/website/assets/img/rudraparasara-v2-page-300.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Rudrapāraśara 1924, v.2, p.300." loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> As we see, the text prints the editor’s footnote to the text with an asterisk and a different font (p. 300, with two references to Jarjaṭa). Note, too, the reference to the Carakasaṃhitā (चरकपाठः). </div> </div> <p>As suggested by Deepro Chakraborty (personal communication), it is more likely that the passage printed in the book is what Rudrapāraśara saw in his source, namely the <em>manuscript</em> of Indu’s commentary. Therefore, the comment would be that of a scribe who produced the manuscript that Rudrapāraśara was reading. This would be a scribal insertion, perhaps from the margin of the archetype of Rudrapāraśara’s manuscript, responding to physical damage to the manuscript, that had migrated into the body of the main text during the next copying. This is a common feature of manuscript transmission. It may be possible to check this, if one can find the manuscript from which Rudrapāraśara was working.</p> <p>Regarding Bhattacharyya’s second assertion, there is nothing in this passage to suggest that Rudrapāraśara had access to a commentary by Jejjaṭa’s on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> On the contrary, the name <em>Nirantarapadī</em> is an abbreviation of the name of Jejjaṭa’s commentary on the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em>, i.e., “<em>Nirantarapadavyākhyā</em>” <a class="citation" href="#zysk-2019">(Zysk &amp; Yamashita, 2019; Sastry &amp; Pandey, 1975)</a>. Further, on p. 300 (above) there is an explicit reference to the version of the passage under discussion as it appears in the text of the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em> (चरकपाठे).</p> <p>Other passages in the <em>Śaśilekhā</em> that require study because they refer to Jejjaṭa include Ni.2.3, Ci.9.50 and 51-52, Utt.30.79 and 80, 38.2-6a <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. 1A: 670)</a></p> <p>While I criticize Bhattacharyya’s assertions above, his 1947 paper was nevertheless a landmark contribution to medical history. He published much valid historical and prosopographical information for the first time through his extremely close reading of the sources.</p> <p>A minor complicating factor is that the 1980 edition of the <em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha</em> edited by Āṭhavale prints the same passage word-for-word the same as in Rudrapāraśara’s edition <a class="citation" href="#atha-1980">(Āṭhavale, 1980, pp. 557-558)</a>. The most likely explanation is that Āṭhavale was simply reproducing Rudrapāraśara’s edition without thought at this point. (A print example of the scribal mechanism described above!) Āṭhavale was fully aware of the earlier edition and frames his own edition as being necessary because Rudrapāraśara’s edition had gone out of print. Only a fresh examination of the manuscripts will clear up this point.</p> <p>In any case, those passages that I have examined from Indu on the <em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha</em> are from Jejjaṭa on the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em>, not the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>. Further study is required to clarify and clarify this.</p> <p>[Later edit:</p> <p>Prof. Tsutomu Yamashita noted in an email (2025-09-06) that in his commentary on the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em>, Jejjaṭa several times referred to the <em>Suśrtasaṃhitā</em>. The following passage illustrates such citations:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Jejjaṭa on Caraka</th> <th>Suśruta passage cited</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Cikitsāsthāna 3</td> <td>Uttaratantra 39</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cikitsāsthāna 24.199–205</td> <td>Uttaratantra 47.49</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>This internal evidence from Jejjaṭa’s own writing shows that he was certainly aware of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> and referred to it. But this does not prove that he wrote a commentary on it.</p> <p>At the time of writing, the fact that Ḍalhaṇa and others apparently cite Jejjaṭa while writing on the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, and that Candraṭa said his revisions to the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> were made after studying Jejjaṭa, make it likely that there was once a commentary by Jejjaṭa on that text. However, the commentary is lost and the manuscripts that have been cited as containing parts of the commentary do not do so.</p> <p>Ḍalhaṇa’s references to Jejjaṭa will be collected in a separate post.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li><div class="row"> <div id="bhat-1947" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>Date and Works of Vāgbhaṭa the Physician</em></div> <div class="author"> Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharyya </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute</em>, 1947 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44028048" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li><div class="row"> <div id="meul-hist" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>A History of Indian Medical Literature</em></div> <div class="author"> Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld </div> <div class="periodical"> 1999 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li><div class="row"> <div id="ncc" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>New Catalogus Catalogorum, An Alphabetical Register of Sanskrit and Allied Works and Authors</em></div> <div class="author"> V.

This commentary is incomplete, but sufficient portions survive to allow a study of the earliest form of medical commentary in India. The extant portions of this commentary are large sections of the Cikitsāsthāna and part of the Kalpasthāna and Siddhisthāna. The text of Nirantarapadavyākhyā by Jajjaṭa has never been critically edited. In this paper, we present a text-critical edition and translation of the Nirantarapadavyākhyā on the Carakasaṃhitā, Cikitsāsthāna Chapter 2, Quarter 1 (CaCi 2.1) based on several copies of a lost palm-leaf manuscript in Malayalam script and the printed edition by Haridatta Śāstrin published in 1941. In order to follow the intellectual development of potency-therapy (vājīkaraṇa) in the Sanskrit medical literature, the remaining three extant major commentaries are also translated from the existing printed editions. These three commentaries are Cakrapāṇidatta’s Āyurvedadīpikā in the eleventh century, Gaṅgādhara’s Jalpakalpataru in the mid-nineteenth century, and Yogīndranāth Sen’s Carakopaskāra in the early-twentieth century.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li><div class="row"> <div id="atha-1980" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgrahaḥ.

Whether the explanatory notes added above and below the text belong to Jaijjaṭa’s commentary does not appear”</p> </blockquote> <p>Some scholars have suggested that this verse describes an actual commentary or independent work of text-criticism by Candraṭa called the <em>Suśrutapāṭhaśuddhi</em> <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. 2A: 123)</a>.</p> <p>The twelfth-century scholar <a href="https://panditproject.org/entity/108218/person">Niścalakara</a>, is renowned for his critical awareness of the work of many medical authors. The breadth and accuracy of his citations tells us that he had an excellent personal library.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/website/assets/img/sharma-1992-page-645-480.webp 480w,/website/assets/img/sharma-1992-page-645-800.webp 800w,/website/assets/img/sharma-1992-page-645-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/website/assets/img/sharma-1992-page-645.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Sharma 1992, p.645." loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> In his discussion of a recipe for treating skin diseases and ringworm, Kuṣṭhacikitsā, 48: 34 <a class="citation" href="#shar-1993">(Sharma, 1993, p. 645)</a>, he appears to have distinguished the “version of Candraṭa" (चन्द्रटपाठ) from the standard text (सुश्रुतपाठ). Niścalakara said that the "version of Candraṭa" read as follows: <br/> लाक्षा कुष्ठं सर्षपाः श्रीनिकेतं रात्रिव्योषं चक्रमर्दस्य बीजम् । कृत्वैकस्थं तक्रपिष्टं प्रलेपो दद्रूषूक्तो मूलकं बीजयुक्तः || <br/> This corresponds almost exactly with the published vulgate text of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* on 4.9.12 <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938, p. 443)</a>. </div> </div> <p>The Nepalese version, however, is somewhat different in phrasing, though more or less identical in meaning:</p> <blockquote> <p>श्रीवेष्टकुष्ठं कुटजं सर्षपा लाक्षा व्योषं प्रपुनाटस्य बीजं। तक्रेण पिष्टः सहरिद्रलेपो दद्द्रूषूक्तो मूलकाबीजयुक्तः ।</p> </blockquote> <p>Niścalakara was exercised to point out that this recipe (in both Suśruta versions) does not contain विडङ्ग (embelia) as does the <em>Cakradatta</em> version of this recipe. But he also pointed out that in some places in the “version of Suśruta” the plant गुग्गुलु (Indian bdellium-tree) is read (as it is in the <em>Cakradatta</em>). We do not see Suśruta manuscripts with this reading. He also pointed out that all sources agree about the inclusion of buttermilk in the recipe and for this reason it should should be included, even though the <em>Cakradatta</em> does not mention it. The way that Niścalakara refers to “all sources” (<em>सर्वत्र</em>) appears to refer to the two versions of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> that he is distinguishing, that of Candraṭa and the “version of Suśruta.” Thus, in twelfth century Bengal, it seems that Niścalakara was aware of two versions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā and distinguished between them in his interpretation of recipes.</p> <p>We are beginning the work of examining the MSS that apparently transmit Candraṭa’s this work, but the suspicion is growing that in fact Candraṭa did not write a <em>separate work</em> with this title. Rather, he produced a <em>version</em> of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> that specifically adhered to the opinions of the commentator Jejjaṭa. The manuscripts we are seeing with the verse cited above are the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, not some commentary on it.</p> <p>This would cast Candraṭa as a scholar who produced a new version of the whole Suśrutasaṃhitā, one that specifically accepted the readings of the earlier commentator Jejjaṭa.</p> <p>The commentator Ḍalhaṇa does not mention Candraṭa’s name anywhere in his extensive commentary. He is elsewhere not shy about citing predecessors, so we deduce that he was not aware of Candraṭa’s work.</p> <p>At present, this is a hypothesis, and our project members are discussing the issue and thinking of ways to test the hypothesis.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li><div class="row"> <div id="egge-1887" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>Catalogue of the Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Library of the India Office.

In the 1915 and 1931 editions, the passage reads :</p> <blockquote> <p>अथास्मै पञ्चविंशतिवर्षाय द्वादशवर्षां पत्नीमावहेत्पित्र्यधर्मार्थकामप्रजाः प्राप्स्यतीति॥</p> <p>Then, a man of twenty-five should take a wife of twelve so that he may obtain children for the sake of ancestral duty, wealth, and pleasure.</p> <p>— Suśrutasaṃhitā Śārīrasthāna 10.53 <a class="citation" href="#susr-1931">(Ācārya, 1931, p. 337)</a></p> </blockquote> <p>But in the 1938 edition, Ācārya emended the passage to read “a wife of sixteen.” Viewed as an important social injunction, this is a major change.</p> <p>In his footnote on this change <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938, p. 392)</a>, Ācārya noted that on this point he was adopting the reading of the “palm leaf manuscript” (<em>षोडशवर्षां इति ता। पुस्तके पठ्यते)</em> and that the other manuscripts he examined read “twelve-year-old” (<em>इतीतरेषु हस्तलिखितपुस्तकेषु</em>). The palm leaf manuscript he refers to is MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333 (siglum H), and it does indeed read <em>षोडशवर्षाम्</em> “sixteen” (scribal folio 197r, line 2, image dscn3174 fol196.jpg ).</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/website/assets/img/sodasavarsampatnim-480.webp 480w,/website/assets/img/sodasavarsampatnim-800.webp 800w,/website/assets/img/sodasavarsampatnim-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/website/assets/img/sodasavarsampatnim.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333, scribal folio 197r, line 2." loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>(As a footnote to a footnote, Ācārya made a typo in his 1938 edition: he printed <em>ṣoḍaṣadaśavarṣāṃ</em>; that this was just a typo is proven by his footnote, where he says “ṣoḍaśavarṣāṃ” <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938, p. 392)</a>.)</p> <p>The small details of philology and textual criticism can make a large difference to the meaning of a text that has real social impact both for our understanding of the past and for custom in India today. Child marriage is still prevalent in India, although its frequency has been declining since the 1981 census due to modernisation, legal and political action and social activism.</p> <h3 id="references">References</h3> <ol class="bibliography"><li><div class="row"> <div id="chak-2018a" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>Jādavjī Trikamjī Ācārya</em></div> <div class="author"> Deepro Chakraborty </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="http://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8z97s417" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">URL</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li><div class="row"> <div id="wuja-2023" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"><em>On the Plastic Surgery of the Ears and Nose.

Currently (August 2025), we have manuscripts from Bikaner, Calcutta, Cambridge, Chandigarh, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jamnagar, Jodhpur, Kathmandu, Kurukshetra, Lahore, London, Lucknow and Pune. We don’t have <em>all</em> the manuscripts from each of these places, and all the manuscripts are partial. But the archive is growing.</p> <p>We need to develop techniques for triaging these manuscripts. That is to say, we are aware of a major cleavage in the history of transmission of the SS, between the Nepalese version and the vulgate. So when we look at a new manuscript, we want to have a rapid way of detecting whether it belongs to one or other of these transmissions, or to another transmission that is different from either.</p> <p>The term “separative error” is a term of art in textual criticism, also known as a <em>Trennfehler. However, separative features of manuscripts need not be errors, but can be innovations or even more simply, differences. Thus, the expression “separative innovations” is perhaps more appropriate <a class="citation" href="#acer-2023">(Acerbi, 2023, p. 2)</a>. What we are after in the present context are easily identifiable passages in a manuscript of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> that will identify that manuscripts as belonging to one or other branch of the stemma. Since we are at present dealing with two branches, the vulgate and the Nepalese Version, “separative differences” are passages that are clearly and definitely included or excluded in one or other version of the text.</p> <p>At first, I thought the absence of the “<em>yathovāca bhagavān dhanvantariḥ</em>” phrase would be a marker of the Nepalese version. But this is not the case. Manuscripts without this phrase still have vulgate readings. That suggests that the Dhanvantari phrase was added after the vulgate branch had already separated from the Nepalese transmission. We need to look more deeply.</p> <p>One area for research is the passages called <em>pratisaṃskartṛsūtras</em> or “sūtras by revisers” by commentators <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(Meulenbeld, 1999, pp. IA 347)</a>. These are passages connected with the comments by Cakrapāṇidatta and – following him – Ḍalhaṇa on the very beginning of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> in which they discuss the idea of an older text being later expanded. Cakra and Ḍalhaṇa thought that the use of the perfect tense (Sanskrit <em>liṭ</em>) was a marker of such added passages, for example SS 1.1.1–2, 1.2.1–2, etc. Meulenbeld provided further detail <a class="citation" href="#meul-hist">(<i>A History of Indian Medical Literature</i>, 1999, pp. IIB 444, note 293)</a>.</p> <p>Therefore we want to develop a series of separative differences, that is to say bold, clear diagnostic differences between the Nepalese and the vulgate transmissions. We want to gather a list of these Trennfehler covering each sthāna, and perhaps several adhyāyas. This blog post will gather such passages.</p> <h2 id="list-of-separative-differences">List of separative differences</h2> <p>Sūtrasthāna, adhyāyas 45 and 46 have many verses in the vulgate that do not appear in the Nepalese version, and vice versa. Separative differences in other sthānas too are listed below. Some of the more obvious differences are as follow. This is not an exhaustive list of such differences, just some of the longer, very clear separative differences where large numbers of passages differ.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>vulgate numbering</th> <th>in vulgate</th> <th>in Nepalese</th> <th>Notes</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.10.4 (ity eke … na samyak phrase)</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.12.6b</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.12.27cd-29ab</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.12.35ef</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.12.39cdef</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.13.5</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> <td>appears in a footnote in the vulgate edition (p.55, n.4) but not in th emain text.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.13.23</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.13.25</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.16.11-14</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.16.26.1-19</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.13-16</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>after 1.45.40 4 verses</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.31-42</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.66-83</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.85-88</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.97-107</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.116–119</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.124-130</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.133-142</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.145-147</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.149-155</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.175-181</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.210, the following 15 verses</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.250-256</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.282-288</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.297-312</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.326-330</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.522-</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2.1.64-68</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.1.3</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> <td>ivodakojasāṃ (see <a href="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/dwellers-in-the-sea/">blog</a>)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.2.10.add1-add11</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.2.30</td> <td> </td> <td>MS H has a saut du même au même</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.2.29-31</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.2.35.1 -
